Joe Wetzel over at Inkwell Ideas put together a
neat <a href="http://www.inkwellideas.com/roleplaying_tools/random_inn/">
Random Inn/Tavern Generator</a> for use in tabletop RPGs. He's still
working on it so it's gradually building up more features. It's just
JavaScript and HTML, so no special plugins are needed for it to
work. Right now it appears to be the only generator that makes
floorplans.
</p>
<p>
It creates a random floorplan using image segments, so you'll have to
screenshot the website if you plan on saving a particular layout as a
single image. It also generates a menu, including prices, which I
think adds a lot of personality to the otherwise bare floorplan.
</p>
<p>
There are controls to fix certain properties of the generator in
place, making it less random, so you can control things such as secret
doors, inn size, and second floors. In the future there are plans for
adding generated NPC staff and patrons, and even plot hooks.

Ameron over at Dungeon's Master just wrote a
post <a href="http://dungeonsmaster.com/2010/05/tavern-trappings/">
Tavern Trappings</a> as a guide for how to fill a tavern with
everything else. It compliments the random inn generator well.
</p>
<p>
If <a href="/blog/2008/12/22/">I ever GM a game someday</a> I think
this would come in handy.
