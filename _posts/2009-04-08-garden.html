<!-- 8 April 2009 -->
<p>
My wife was interested in growing a garden this summer. She has never
done it before and wanted to learn. However, we live in an apartment
so we don't exactly have a yard. Instead, we got some pots and started
growing a balcony garden.
</p>
<p>
I thought we were being clever, but it turns out this is a common
practice called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_garden">container
gardening</a>. Searches online for "balcony gardening", "apartment
gardening", and "container gardening" will bring up lots of useful
information.
</p>
<p>
I think it's more convenient than regular gardening, as the plants are
practically in the apartment. In fact, it's about 4 feet from our bed,
through the balcony door. We can move the plants around to the other
balcony, or even inside, if needed.

Gardening is a lot of fun, really.

This year, we are growing (or trying to grow) carrots, peppers,
strawberries, catnip, and dactylis (cat grass). We'll see how things
turn out in a couple months. Here's how it looks right now,
