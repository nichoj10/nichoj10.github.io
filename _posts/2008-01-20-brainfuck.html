<p>
<a href="https://github.com/skeeto/bfc">wbf2c</a> converts an esoteric
programming language
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">brainfuck</a>
into C code which can be machine compiled. Several optimizations are
done to make the resulting program extremely fast an efficient. The
converter supports both a static (standard 30,000 cells) array or a
dynamically-sized array. It also supports many different cell types,
from the standard <code>char</code> to multi-precision cells
using <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a>.
</p>
<p>
The converter can also run several brainfuck programs on the same
memory array at once by running each one in a thread. To make sure
each brainfuck operation is atomic, each cell gets a mutex lock. The
only other multi-threading brainfuck implementation I know of
is <a href="http://www.clanpogo.dk/pogocms/index.php?action=bf">
Brainfork</a>.
</p>
<p>
For an example of some brainfuck code I wrote,
</p>
<pre>
+&gt;+&lt;
[
[-&gt;&gt;+&gt;+&lt;&lt;&lt;]&gt;&gt;&gt;
[-&lt;&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;&gt;]&lt;&lt;

[-&gt;+&gt;+&lt;&lt;]&gt;&gt;
[-&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;]&lt;&lt;
]
</pre>
<p>
This program fills the memory with the Fibonacci series. Make sure you
use the dynamically sized array, along with the bignum cell
type. After two or three seconds of running, my laptop (unmodified
Dell Inspiron 1000) can calculate and spit out a 140MB text file
containing the first 50,000 numbers in the series. I used
the <code>-d</code> dump option to see this output.

Download information, as well as some more examples, including a
multi-threaded one, are on the project website.
