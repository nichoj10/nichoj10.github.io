<p class="abstract">
Update January 2013: this package has been refined and formally
renamed
to <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/javadoc-lookup">javadoc-lookup</a>.
The user interface is essentially the same — under different function
names — but with some extra goodies. It's available for install from
MELPA.
</p>

<p>
I keep running to either a search engine or, when offline, manually
browsing to Java API documentation when I need to look something
up. When I'm using Emacs this is stupid, so I fixed it. I put together
a <code>java-docs</code> package that let's me quickly jump to
documentation from within Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Repository: <code>git clone <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-java">git://github.com/skeeto/javadoc-lookup.git</a></code>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it launches it in a web browser right now because there
doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to render the
documentation <i>inside</i> Emacs itself. So
you'll <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BrowseUrl"> need to
have <code>browse-url</code> set up properly</a> in your
configuration.
</p>
<p>
I strongly recommend you use this
with <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings">
Ido</a>, which comes with Emacs. If you do, you'll want to load
it <i>after</i> you enable <code>ido-mode</code>, which will enable
the Ido minibuffer completion in <code>java-docs</code>.
</p>
<p>
So, after you <code>require</code> <code>java-docs</code>, you give it
a list of places to look for documentation.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(require 'java-docs)
(java-docs "/usr/share/doc/openjdk-6-jdk/api" "~/src/project/doc")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
It will scan these locations and build up an index of
classes. <a href="/blog/2010/06/07/">If you're using a recent enough
version of Emacs</a> it will cache that index for faster loading in
the future, since on <i>certain</i> systems it can needlessly take a
bit of time.
</p>
<p>
After that you can jump to documentation with <code>C-h j</code>
(<code>java-docs-lookup</code>). It will ask you what you want to look
up and offer completion with your preferred completion function.

  </a>
</p>
<p>
If you don't want to open it up in an external browser, you can set
Emacs to run a text-based browser inside itself.

(setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-text-emacs)
