*Update 2018: Ren√©Rebe builds upon this article in an [interesting
follow-up video][update1] ([part 2][update2]).*

*Update 2020: DOS Defender [was featured on GET OFF MY LAWN][update3].*

This past weekend I participated in [Ludum Dare #31][ld31]. Before the
theme was even announced, due to [recent fascination][lzss] I wanted
to make an old school DOS game. DOSBox would be the target platform
since it's the most practical way to run DOS applications anymore,
despite modern x86 CPUs still being fully backwards compatible all the
way back to the 16-bit 8086.

I successfully created and submitted a DOS game called [DOS
Defender][dd]. It's a 32-bit 80386 real mode DOS COM program. All
assets are embedded in the executable and there are no external
dependencies, so the entire game is packed into that 10kB binary.

You'll need a joystick/gamepad in order to play. I included mouse
support in the Ludum Dare release in order to make it easier to
review, but this was removed because it doesn't work well.

The most technically interesting part is that **I didn't need *any*
DOS development tools to create this**! I only used my every day Linux
C compiler (`gcc`). It's not actually possible to build DOS Defender
in DOS. Instead, I'm treating DOS as an embedded platform, which is
the only form in which [DOS still exists today][freedos]. Along with
DOSBox and [DOSEMU][dosemu], this is a pretty comfortable toolchain.

If all you care about is how to do this yourself, skip to the
"Tricking GCC" section, where we'll write a "Hello, World" DOS COM
program with Linux's GCC.

### Finding the right tools

I didn't have GCC in mind when I started this project. What really
triggered all of this was that I had noticed Debian's [bcc][bcc]
package, Bruce's C Compiler, that builds 16-bit 8086 binaries. It's
kept around for compiling x86 bootloaders and such, but it can also be
used to compile DOS COM files, which was the part that interested me.

For some background: the Intel 8086 was a 16-bit microprocessor
released in 1978. It had none of the fancy features of today's CPU: no
memory protection, no floating point instructions, and only up to 1MB
of RAM addressable. All modern x86 desktops and laptops can still
pretend to be a 40-year-old 16-bit 8086 microprocessor, with the same
limited addressing and all. That's some serious backwards
compatibility. This feature is called *real mode*. It's the mode in
which all x86 computers boot. Modern operating systems switch to
*protected mode* as soon as possible, which provides virtual
addressing and safe multi-tasking. DOS is not one of these operating
systems.

Unfortunately, bcc is not an ANSI C compiler. It supports a subset of
K&R C, along with inline x86 assembly. Unlike other 8086 C compilers,
it has no notion of "far" or "long" pointers, so inline assembly is
required to access [other memory segments][seg] (VGA, clock, etc.).
Side note: the remnants of these 8086 "long pointers" still exists
today in the Win32 API: `LPSTR`, `LPWORD`, `LPDWORD`, etc. The inline
assembly isn't anywhere near as nice as GCC's inline assembly. The
assembly code has to manually load variables from the stack so, since
bcc supports two different calling conventions, the assembly ends up
being hard-coded to one calling convention or the other.

Given all its limitations, I went looking for alternatives.

### DJGPP

[DJGPP][djgpp] is the DOS port of GCC. It's a very impressive project,
bringing almost all of POSIX to DOS. The DOS ports of many programs
are built with DJGPP. In order to achieve this, it only produces
32-bit protected mode programs. If a protected mode program needs to
manipulate hardware (i.e. VGA), it must make requests to a [DOS
Protected Mode Interface][dpmi] (DPMI) service. If I used DJGPP, I
couldn't make a single, standalone binary as I had wanted, since I'd
need to include a DPMI server. There's also a performance penalty for
making DPMI requests.

Getting a DJGPP toolchain working can be difficult, to put it kindly.
Fortunately I found a useful project, [build-djgpp][build], that makes
it easy, at least on Linux.

Either there's a serious bug or the official DJGPP binaries [have
become infected again][virus], because in my testing I kept getting
the "Not COFF: check for viruses" error message when running my
programs in DOSBox. To double check that it's not an infection on my
own machine, I set up a DJGPP toolchain on my Raspberry Pi, to act as
a clean room. It's impossible for this ARM-based device to get
infected with an x86 virus. It still had the same problem, and all the
binary hashes matched up between the machines, so it's not my fault.

So given the DPMI issue and the above, I moved on.

### Tricking GCC

What I finally settled on is a neat hack that involves "tricking" GCC
into producing real mode DOS COM files, so long as it can target 80386
(as is usually the case). The 80386 was released in 1985 and was the
first 32-bit x86 microprocessor. GCC still targets this instruction
set today, even in the x86-64 toolchain. Unfortunately, GCC cannot
actually produce 16-bit code, so my main goal of targeting 8086 would
not be achievable. This doesn't matter, though, since DOSBox, my
intended platform, is an 80386 emulator.

In theory this should even work unchanged with MinGW, but there's a
long-standing MinGW bug that prevents it from working right ("cannot
perform PE operations on non PE output file"). It's still do-able, and
I did it myself, but you'll need to drop the `OUTPUT_FORMAT` directive
and add an extra `objcopy` step (`objcopy -O binary`).

#### Hello World in DOS

To demonstrate how to do all this, let's make a DOS "Hello, World" COM
program using GCC on Linux.

There's a significant burden with this technique: **there will be no
standard library**. It's basically like writing an operating system
from scratch, except for the few services DOS provides. This means no
`printf()` or anything of the sort. Instead we'll ask DOS to print a
string to the terminal. Making a request to DOS means firing an
interrupt, which means inline assembly!

DOS has nine interrupts: 0x20, 0x21, 0x22, 0x23, 0x24, 0x25, 0x26,
0x27, 0x2F. The big one, and the one we're interested in, is 0x21,
function 0x09 (print string). Between DOS and BIOS, there are
[thousands of functions called this way][dosref]. I'm not going to try
to explain x86 assembly, but in short the function number is stuffed
into register `ah` and interrupt 0x21 is fired. Function 0x09 also
takes an argument, the pointer to the string to be printed, which is
passed in registers `dx` and `ds`.

Here's the GCC inline assembly `print()` function. Strings passed to
this function must be terminated with a `$`. Why? Because DOS.

~~~c
static void print(char *string)
{
    asm volatile ("mov   $0x09, %%ah\n"
                  "int   $0x21\n"
                  : /* no output */
                  : "d"(string)
                  : "ah");
}
~~~

The assembly is declared `volatile` because it has a side effect
(printing the string). To GCC, the assembly is an opaque hunk, and the
optimizer relies in the output/input/clobber constraints (the last
three lines). For DOS programs like this, all inline assembly will
have side effects. This is because it's not being written for
optimization but to access hardware and DOS, things not accessible to
plain C.

Care must also be taken by the caller, because GCC doesn't know that
the memory pointed to by `string` is ever read. It's likely the array
that backs the string needs to be declared `volatile` too. This is all
foreshadowing into what's to come: doing anything in this environment
is an endless struggle against the optimizer. Not all of these battles
can be won.

Now for the main function. The name of this function shouldn't matter,
but I'm avoiding calling it `main()` since MinGW has a funny ideas
about mangling this particular symbol, even when it's asked not to.

~~~c
int dosmain(void)
{
    print("Hello, World!\n$");
    return 0;
}
~~~

COM files are limited to 65,279 bytes in size. This is because an x86
memory segment is 64kB and COM files are simply loaded by DOS to
0x0100 in the segment and executed. There are no headers, it's just a
raw binary. Since a COM program can never be of any significant size,
and no real linking needs to occur (freestanding), the entire thing
will be compiled as one translation unit. It will be one call to GCC
with a bunch of options.

#### Compiler Options

Here are the essential compiler options.

    -std=gnu99 -Os -nostdlib -m32 -march=i386 -ffreestanding

Since no standard libraries are in use, the only difference between
gnu99 and c99 is that trigraphs are disabled (as they should be) and
inline assembly can be written as `asm` instead of `__asm__`. It's a
no brainer. This project will be so closely tied to GCC that I don't
care about using GCC extensions anyway.

I'm using `-Os` to keep the compiled output as small as possible. It
will also make the program run faster. This is important when
targeting DOSBox because, by default, it will deliberately run as slow
as a machine from the 1980's. I want to be able to fit in that
constraint. If the optimizer is causing problems, you may need to
temporarily make this `-O0` to determine if the problem is your fault
or the optimizer's fault.

You see, the optimizer doesn't understand that the program will be
running in real mode, and under its addressing constraints. **It will
perform all sorts of invalid optimizations that break your perfectly
valid programs.** It's not a GCC bug since we're doing crazy stuff
here. I had to rework my code a number of times to stop the optimizer
from breaking my program. For example, I had to avoid returning
complex structs from functions because they'd sometimes be filled with
garbage. The real danger here is that a future version of GCC will be
more clever and will break more stuff. In this battle, `volatile` is
your friend.

Th next option is `-nostdlib`, since there are no valid libraries for
us to link against, even statically.

The options `-m32 -march=i386` set the compiler to produce 80386 code.
If I was writing a bootloader for a modern computer, targeting 80686
would be fine, too, but DOSBox is 80386.

The `-ffreestanding` argument requires that GCC not emit code that
calls built-in standard library helper functions. Sometimes instead of
emitting code to do something, it emits code that calls a built-in
function to do it, especially with math operators. This was one of the
main problems I had with bcc, where this behavior couldn't be
disabled. This is most commonly used in writing bootloaders and
kernels. And now DOS COM files.

#### Linker Options

The `-Wl` option is used to pass arguments to the linker (`ld`). We
need it since we're doing all this in one call to GCC.

    -Wl,--nmagic,--script=com.ld

The `--nmagic` turns off page alignment of sections. One, we don't
need this. Two, that would waste precious space. In my tests it
doesn't appear to be necessary, but I'm including it just in case.

The `--script` option tells the linker that we want to use a custom
[linker script][ls]. This allows us to precisely lay out the sections
(`text`, `data`, `bss`, `rodata`) of our program. Here's the `com.ld`
script.

    OUTPUT_FORMAT(binary)
    SECTIONS
    {
        . = 0x0100;
        .text :
        {
            *(.text);
        }
        .data :
        {
            *(.data);
            *(.bss);
            *(.rodata);
        }
        _heap = ALIGN(4);
    }

The `OUTPUT_FORMAT(binary)` says not to put this into an ELF (or PE,
etc.) file. The linker should just dump the raw code. A COM file is
just raw code, so this means the linker will produce a COM file!

I had said that COM files are loaded to `0x0100`. The fourth line
offsets the binary to this location. The first byte of the COM file
will still be the first byte of code, but it will be designed to run
from that offset in memory.

What follows is all the sections, `text` (program), `data` (static
data), `bss` (zero-initialized data), `rodata` (strings). Finally I
mark the end of the binary with the symbol `_heap`. This will come in
handy later for writing `sbrk()`, after we're done with "Hello,
World." I've asked for the `_heap` position to be 4-byte aligned.

We're almost there.

#### Program Startup

The linker is usually aware of our entry point (`main`) and sets that
up for us. But since we asked for "binary" output, we're on our own.
If the `print()` function is emitted first, our program's execution
will begin with executing that function, which is invalid. Our program
needs a little header stanza to get things started.

The linker script has a `STARTUP` option for handling this, but to
keep it simple we'll put that right in the program. This is usually
called `crt0.o` or `Boot.o`, in case those names every come up in your
own reading. This inline assembly *must* be the very first thing in
our code, before any includes and such. DOS will do most of the setup
for us, we really just have to jump to the entry point.

~~~c
asm (".code16gcc\n"
     "call  dosmain\n"
     "mov   $0x4C, %ah\n"
     "int   $0x21\n");
~~~

The `.code16gcc` tells the assembler that we're going to be running in
real mode, so that it makes the proper adjustment. Despite the name,
this will *not* make it produce 16-bit code! First it calls `dosmain`,
the function we wrote above. Then it informs DOS, using function
`0x4C` (terminate with return code), that we're done, passing the exit
code along in the 1-byte register `al` (already set by `dosmain`).
This inline assembly is automatically `volatile` because it has no
inputs or outputs.

#### Everything at Once

Here's the entire C program.

~~~c
asm (".code16gcc\n"
     "call  dosmain\n"
     "mov   $0x4C,%ah\n"
     "int   $0x21\n");

static void print(char *string)
{
    asm volatile ("mov   $0x09, %%ah\n"
                  "int   $0x21\n"
                  : /* no output */
                  : "d"(string)
                  : "ah");
}

int dosmain(void)
{
    print("Hello, World!\n$");
    return 0;
}
~~~

I won't repeat `com.ld`. Here's the call to GCC.

    gcc -std=gnu99 -Os -nostdlib -m32 -march=i386 -ffreestanding \
        -o hello.com -Wl,--nmagic,--script=com.ld hello.c

And testing it in DOSBox:

![](/img/screenshot/dosbox-hello.png)

From here if you want fancy graphics, it's just a matter of making an
interrupt and [writing to VGA memory][vga]. If you want sound you can
perform an interrupt for the PC speaker. I haven't sorted out how to
call Sound Blaster yet. It was from this point that I grew DOS
Defender.

### Memory Allocation

To cover one more thing, remember that `_heap` symbol? We can use it
to implement `sbrk()` for dynamic memory allocation within the main
program segment. This is real mode, and there's no virtual memory, so
we're free to write to any memory we can address at any time. Some of
this is reserved (i.e. low and high memory) for hardware. So using
`sbrk()` specifically isn't *really* necessary, but it's interesting
to implement ourselves.

As is normal on x86, your text and segments are at a low address
(0x0100 in this case) and the stack is at a high address (around
0xffff in this case). On Unix-like systems, the memory returned by
`malloc()` comes from two places: `sbrk()` and `mmap()`. What `sbrk()`
does is allocates memory just above the text/data segments, growing
"up" towards the stack. Each call to `sbrk()` will grow this space (or
leave it exactly the same). That memory would then managed by
`malloc()` and friends.

Here's how we can get `sbrk()` in a COM program. Notice I have to
define my own `size_t`, since we don't have a standard library.

~~~c
typedef unsigned short  size_t;

extern char _heap;
static char *hbreak = &_heap;

static void *sbrk(size_t size)
{
    char *ptr = hbreak;
    hbreak += size;
    return ptr;
}
~~~

It just sets a pointer to `_heap` and grows it as needed. A slightly
smarter `sbrk()` would be careful about alignment as well.

In the making of DOS Defender an interesting thing happened. I was
(incorrectly) counting on the memory return by my `sbrk()` being
zeroed. This was the case the first time the game ran. However, DOS
doesn't zero this memory between programs. When I would run my game
again, *it would pick right up where it left off*, because the same
data structures with the same contents were loaded back into place. A
pretty cool accident! It's part of what makes this a fun embedded
platform.
