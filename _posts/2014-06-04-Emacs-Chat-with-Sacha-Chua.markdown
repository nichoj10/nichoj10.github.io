My [previously][announce] mentioned [*Emacs Chat* with Sacha
Chua][chat] went well and the recording is available. At my request,
Sacha agreed to put these recordings in the public domain, so they're
completely free for any purpose with no strings attached.

A number of my Emacs projects were mentioned, most of which I've
previously written articles about here.

* Web development with [Skewer][skewer].
* [Elfeed][elfeed], an Emacs web feed reader.
* My [with-package][with-package] macro.
* An [Emacs FFI][ffi].
* Collaboration with [impatient-mode][imp].
* My Emacs SQL database front-end, [EmacSQL][emacsql].
* And one I haven't written about yet, [autotetris-mode][tetris].

If you enjoyed this *Emacs Chat*, remember that there are [a lot more
of them][ec]! The [chat with Phil Hagelberg][phil] is probably my
favorite so far.
