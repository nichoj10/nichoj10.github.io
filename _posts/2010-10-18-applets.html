<p class="abstract">
  Update February 2013: Java Applets are a dead technology and using a
  Java web browser plugin is simply much too insecure. I strongly
  recommend against it. This applet page has since been moved to a
  more generally-named URL.
</p>

<p>
Because the two projects I announced over the weekend can be used as
Java applets, I went back and upgraded <a href="/blog/2007/10/08/">
two older</a> <a href="/blog/2009/12/13/">projects</a> so that they
could also behave as interactive applets. Now that I have several
applets to show off I've collected them together onto a "Java Applet
Demos" page.

<p>
I intend on expanding this in the near future with improvements
(Michael is unhappy with my integration function on the water wheel,
for one) and new applets <a href="/blog/2010/10/15/">while I'm on a
roll</a>. Swing is my oyster.
