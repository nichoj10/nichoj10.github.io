Welcome to **null program**. This is my new home as my [student
location](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~wellons) will no longer exist in a
few months. Here is where I will share my projects and ideas, even if
no one is looking, reading, or caring.

The name for this website comes from a phrase spoken in several places
in my favorite book, *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*. If you have not
read this book, you are missing out. I recommend you go to the nearest
library immediately and read it. Amazon lets you [read the first
chapter online][read] if you want to get a taste of it. When I started
reading it, I was hooked right away. Why is it a great book? Because
it is about an American Revolution style libertarian revolution on the
moon, and the hero character is a computer engineer. What book can get
better than that?

I would like to post something interesting here about once a week or
so. I am taking classes right now, so getting ideas should be
relatively easy. The first few posts will probably be repeating things
I have already published at my old student location. This will include
little intros to my old projects and a bunch of code snippets.

Also, separate from this blog thing are my projects, such as the PNG
Archiver and binitools. <del>These have a permanent home located under
projects/</del>. (*No longer here, after changing web hosts.*)

I am a big [free software][free] fan and you will probably see the
[GNU project][gnu] being mentioned a lot around here. I also use
[Emacs][emacs] for just about everything I can. Here is more advice:
learn to use Emacs. You will become much more productive. After using
Emacs for awhile, you will begin loathing word processors and mice
(the computer kind). More on this later.
