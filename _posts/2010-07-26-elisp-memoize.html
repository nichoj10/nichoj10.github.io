<a href="/blog/2008/03/25/">Memoization</a> is something I think
should be packaged as a standard function for just about every
language. That's not generally the case, but luckily this is easy to
fix in Lisps. I needed memoization recently for an Elisp project I'm
working on. I could have hand-written one but a generic memoization
function would have worked just fine. Since I didn't find any generic
Elisp memoization on-line I wrote my own.

Just put it in your path
and <code>(require 'memoize)</code> it. Here's the core
function.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
;; ID: 83bae208-da65-3e26-2ecb-4941fb310848
(defun memoize-wrap (func)
  "Return the memoized version of FUNC."
  (lexical-let ((table (make-hash-table :test 'equal)))
    (lambda (&rest args)
      (let ((value (gethash args table)))
        (if value
            value
          (puthash args (apply func args) table))))))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The hash table is stored inside the fake closure provided by
<code>lexical-let</code>. In a previous version of this function, I
stored it in an uninterned symbol, which is what is going on behind
the scenes of <code>lexical-let</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note that in the full code it keeps the original function
documentation intact. I want the memoization wrapper to be an
unobtrusive as possible.
</p>
<p>
Here's a demo of it in action. This <code>whiten</code> function is
computationally expensive: it performs key whitening. It repeats a
hash function thousands of times to produce an expensive value. This
isn't something you generally want to memoize, but stick with me.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
(defun whiten (key)
  "Perform key whitening with the md5 hash function."
  (dotimes (i 100000 key)
    (setq key (md5 key))))

(whiten "password")   ; takes a couple of seconds
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
On my laptop that takes a couple of seconds to run. Increase that
counter if it's quick on your computer. My memoize package provides
a <code>memoize</code> function which will create a new function that
wraps the original, then installs the new function in place of the old
one if we give it the function symbol.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
(memoize 'whiten)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The first time you run it after memoization it will be slow, but after
that the memoization kicks in for a quick return.
</p>
<p>
There are two Elisp specific issues at hand. First is that memoizing
an interactive function will produce a non-interactive function. It
would be easy to fix this problem when it comes to non-byte-compiled
functions, but recovering the interactive definition from a
byte-compiled function is more complex than I care to deal
with. Besides, interactive functions are always used for their side
effects so there's no reason to memoize them.
</p>
<p>
Second is a limitation of Elisp hash tables. There's no way to
distinguish a nil value and no value. The hash table returns nil for
both. This means you cannot memoize nil returns. But a computationally
expensive function shouldn't be returning nil anyway.
</p>
<p>
<i>Update</i>: As of August 2012, me and several other people have
gotten good mileage out of this function! It's an essential part of my
Emacs dotfiles.
