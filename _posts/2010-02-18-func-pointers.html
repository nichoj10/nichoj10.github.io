Here's something I only learned recently, since it came up when
working on <a href="/blog/2010/01/24/"> Wisp</a>. In C function
pointers are incompatible with normal pointers. For example, this is
unportable C,
</p>

{% highlight c %}
int func (int x);

int main ()
{
  void *p = (void *) &func;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This is because function pointers are a different size than other
pointers on some architectures, or even within the same architecture
with different models (x86's compact and medium models). If the
compiler in such a scenario allowed this, the pointer may be truncated
and would likely point to the wrong place. It wasn't until I added
the <code>-pedantic</code> flag to gcc that it started warning me
about situations like the above. The <code>-W -Wall</code> flags are
silent here.
</p>
<p>
The relevant part of
the <a href="http://flash-gordon.me.uk/ansi.c.txt"> ANSI C
standard</a> lists the following as a common, but unportable,
extension to the language,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    A pointer to an object or to void may be cast to a pointer to a
    function, allowing data to be invoked as a function. A pointer to
    a function may be cast to a pointer to an object or to void,
    allowing a function to be inspected or modified (for example, by a
    debugger).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is a discussion, including an example, on Stack
Overflow: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1473935/can-the-size-of-pointers-vary-depending-on-whats-pointed-to">
Can the Size of Pointers Vary Depending on what's Pointed To?</a>. It
also links to this comp.lang.c FAQ
question <a href="http://c-faq.com/ptrs/generic.html">Question
4.13</a> suggesting the use of a union, which is exactly what I did in
Wisp.
</p>
<p>
I bet this issue only comes up very rarely. How often do you have to
store a function pointer in a void pointer? It subverts the type
system and is generally a bad idea. I had to do it in Wisp as part of
its value polymorphism, which is why it bit me. This is probably why
gcc doesn't get very picky over it.
</p>
<p>
This also means function pointers have less support than normal
pointers. For example, printing pointers
with <code>printf()</code>'s <code>%p</code> won't work, since it
expects a <code>void</code> pointer, so there's no printing them. You
can't sort them with <code>qsort()</code>. You can even treat the
function pointer as a blob of data to manipulate manually since
there's no safe way to make a regular pointer to it. Really, almost
any C library function that accepts pointers won't work with function
pointers.
</p>
<p>
So if you want a tricky, unfair, interview question this could be
one!
