Update: This is now part of my
<a href="https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-java">
<code>java-mode-plus</code></a> Emacs extension.
</p>
<p>
Developing C in Emacs is a real joy, and it's mostly thanks to the
compile command. Once you have your Makefile — or SConstruct or
whatever build system you like — setup and you want to compile your
latest changes, just run <code>M-x compile</code>, which will run your
build system in a buffer. You can then step through the errors and
warnings with <code>C-x `</code>, and Emacs will take you to them.
It's a very nice way to write code.
</p>
<p>
I use the compile command so much that I bound it to <code>C-x
C-k</code> (<code>C-k</code> tends to be part of compile key
bindings),
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(global-set-key "\C-x\C-k" 'compile)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Until recently, I didn't have as nice of a setup for Java. Since they
generally force offensive IDEs onto me at work this wasn't something I
needed yet anyway, but <i>I</i> get to choose my environment on a new
project this time. If you're using Makefiles for some reason when
building your Java project, it still works out fairly well because
they're usually called recursively. It gets more complicated with <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, where there is only one
top-level build file. Emacs' compile command only runs the build
command in the buffer's current directory.
</p>
<p>
I know three solutions to this problem. One is to provide the build
file's absolute path when <code>compile</code> asks for the command
with the <code>-buildfile</code> (<code>-f</code>) option. You only
need to type it once per Emacs session, so that's not <i>too</i> bad.
</p>
<pre>
ant -emacs -buildfile /path/to/build.xml
</pre>
<p>
It's not well documented, but there is a <code>-find</code> option
that can be given to Ant that will cause it to search for the build
file itself. This is even nicer than the previous solution. Just
remember to place it last, unless you give it the build filename
too. For example, if you wanted to run the <code>clean</code> target,
</p>
<pre>
ant -emacs clean -find
</pre>
<p>
To keep the actual call as simple as possible, I wrote a wrapper for
<code>compile</code>, and put a hook in <code>java-mode</code> to
change the local binding. The wrapper, <code>ant-compile</code>,
searches for the build file the same way <code>-find</code> would do.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun ant-compile ()
  "Traveling up the path, find build.xml file and run compile."
  (interactive)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (while (and (not (file-exists-p "build.xml"))
                (not (equal "/" default-directory)))
      (cd ".."))
    (call-interactively 'compile)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
So I can transparently keep using my muscle memory compile binding, I
set up the key binding in a hook,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(add-hook 'java-mode-hook
          (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-x\C-k" 'ant-compile)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Voila! Java works looks a little bit more like C.
