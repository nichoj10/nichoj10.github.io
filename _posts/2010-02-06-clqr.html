<p>
I found this <a href="http://clqr.berlios.de/"> Common Lisp Quick
Reference</a> the other day
from <a href="http://old.reddit.com/r/lisp/"> r/lisp</a>, and I think
it's <i>fantastic</i>. It's a comprehensive, libre booklet of the
symbols defined by the Common Lisp ANSI standard. Very slick!
</p>
<p>
The main version is meant to be printed out and nested with a vertical
fold, and it works quite well. If I ever get a chance to use Common
Lisp at work (a man can dream), probably at a location without
Internet access, this could come in handy. So I printed out one for
myself,
