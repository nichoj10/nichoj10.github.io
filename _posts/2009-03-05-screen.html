<p>
Another useful program I use every week is <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/"> GNU Screen</a>. It
provides virtual terminals at a single terminal. It's a bit like a
window manager for a text terminal. If you are a command line junkie
(and if you are at all serious about computing, you should be), this
is an essential piece of software.
</p>
<p>
The main reason I use screen is for its persistence. If I am running a
long-running job on a remote machine (i.e. over ssh), like a large
<code>apt-get upgrade</code>, I'll put it in a screen session. This
way I can log out and, later, log in from anywhere and check on it. I
have even used it to persist <a href="/blog/2008/09/17/"> nethack</a>
sessions, though this isn't really necessary.
</p>
<p>
The only annoying part is that all of it's mappings are underneath C-a
(ctrl+a), which is a very common Emacs/bash command, which I use a
lot. To get the effect of C-a inside screen, you have to do it twice
in a row because screen captures the first one.

If you don't already use it, try it out sometime.
