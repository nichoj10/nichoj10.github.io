Here's something interesting I saw on Wikipedia. There is a map of the
US with states colored according to the spread of the H1N1 flu
epidemic. Take a look: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H1N1_USA_Map.svg">
H1N1_USA_Map.svg</a>. The interesting part is actually at the bottom
of that image page.

Wikipedia, being a wiki, versions everything. It has to. No one
actually changes a page, they just add a new version that is a
derivative of the "current" version. Because of this, Wikipedia has
incidentally created a time-lapse version of the map in its version
control system. In case you can't see it when you are reading this,
here's what part of it looks like,
</p>
<p class="center">

     title="Wikipedia versioning"/>
</p>
<p>
That's the timestamp and the state of the spread at that time,
presented in an extremely useful way. And this was created by
accident. Pretty cool, eh?
