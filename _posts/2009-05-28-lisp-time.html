<p>
I wanted an elisp macro that could measure the running time of a block
of code. Specifically, I wanted it to work like this,
</p>
<pre>
(measure-time
  <i>...
  body
  ...</i>)
</pre>
<p>
And it would return the running time as seconds in floating
point. Well, here's a macro that does it!
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;; ID: 6a3f3d99-f0da-329a-c01c-bb6b868f3239
(defmacro measure-time (&rest body)
  "Measure and return the running time of the code block."
  (declare (indent defun))
  (let ((start (make-symbol "start")))
    `(let ((,start (float-time)))
       ,@body
       (- (float-time) ,start))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
It's only good for up to around 18 hours, then the time integer
overflows. If only Emacs had arbitrary precision numbers. Here it is
in action using my <a href="/blog/2009/05/23">binomial function from
last week</a>.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(measure-time
  (nck 20 10)
  (nck 30 7))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Which, just now, returned <code>3.643713</code> seconds when executed.
</p>
