In a <a href="/blog/2009/03/16"> previous post</a> about the LZMA
compression algorithm, I made a negative comment about zip archives
and moved on. I would like to go into more detail about it now.
</p>
<p>
A zip archive serves three functions all-in-one: compression, archive,
and encryption. On a unix-like system, these functions would normally
provided by three separate tools, like tar, gzip/bzip2, and GnuPG. The
unix philosophy says to "write programs that do one thing and do it
well".
</p>
<p>
So in the case of zip archives, we are doing three things poorly when,
instead, we should be using three separate tools that each do one
thing well.
</p>
<p>
When we use three different tools, our encrypted archive is a lot like
an onion. On the outside we have encryption. After we peel that off by
decrypting it, we have compression, and after removing that lair,
finally the archive. This is reflected in the filename:
<code>.tar.gz.gpg</code>. As a side note, if GPG didn't already
support it, we could add base-64 encoding if needed as another layer
on the onion: <code>.tar.gz.gpg.b64</code>.
</p>
<p>
By using separate tools, we can also swap different tools in and out
without breaking any spec. Previously I mentioned using LZMA, which
could be used in place of gzip or bzip2. Instead of
<code>.tar.gz.gpg</code> you can have <code>.tar.lzma.gpg</code>. Or
you can swap out GPG for encryption and use, say, <a
href="http://ciphersaber.gurus.org/">CipherSaber</a> as
<code>.tar.lzma.cs2</code>. If we use a single one-size-fits-all
format, we are limited by the spec.
</p>
<h4>Compression</h4>
<p>
Both zip and gzip basically use the same compression algorithm. The
zip spec actually allows for a variety of other compression
algorithms, but you cannot rely on other tools to support them.
</p>
<p>
Zip archives are also inside out. Instead of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_archive"> solid
compression</a>, which is what happens in tarballs, each file is
compressed individually. Redundancy between different files cannot be
exploited. The equivalent would be an inside out tarball:
<code>.gz.tar</code>. This would be produced by first individually
gzipping each file in a directory tree, then archiving them with
tar. This results in larger archive sizes.
</p>
<p>
However, there is an advantage to inside out archives: random
access. We can access a file in the middle of the archive without
having to take the whole thing apart. In general use, this sort of
thing isn't really needed, and solid compression would be more useful.
</p>
<h4>Archive</h4>
<p>
In a zip archive, timestamp resolution is limited to 2 seconds, which
is based on the old FAT filesystem time resolution. If your system
supports finer timestamps, you will lose information. But really, this
isn't a big deal.
</p>
<p>
It also does not store file ownership information, but this is also
not a big deal. It may even be desirable as a privacy measure.
</p>
<p>
Actually, the archive part of zip seems to be pretty reasonable, and
better than I thought it was. There don't seem to be any really
annoying problems with it.
</p>
<p>
Tar is still has advantages over zip. Zip doesn't quite allow the same
range of filenames as unix-like systems do, but it does allow
characters like * and ?. What happens when you extract files with
names containing these characters on an inferior operating system that
forbids them will depend on the tool.
</p>
<h4>Encryption</h4>
<p>
Encryption is where zip has been awful in the past. The original
spec's encryption algorithm had serious flaws and no one should even
consider using them today.
</p>
<p>
Since then, AES encryption has been worked into the standard and
implemented differently by different tools. Unless the same zip tool
is used on each end, you can't be sure AES encryption will work.
</p>
<p>
By placing encryption as part of the file spec, each tool has to
implement its own encryption, probably leaving out considerations like
using secure memory. These tools are concentrating on archiving and
compression, and so encryption will likely not be given a solid
effort.
</p>
<p>
In the implementations I know of, the archive index isn't encrypted,
so someone could open it up and see lots of file metadata, including
filenames.
</p>
<p>
When you encrypt a tarball with GnuPG, you have all the flexibility of
PGP available. Asymmetric encryption, web of trust, multiple strong
encryption algorithms, digital signatures, strong key management,
etc. It would be unreasonable for an archive format to have this kind
of thing built in.
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
You are almost always better off using a tarball rather than a zip
archive. Unfortunately the receiver of an archive will often be unable
to open anything else, so you may have no choice.
