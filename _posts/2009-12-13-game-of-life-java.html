Since I recently got back into Java recently, I threw together this
little Game of Life implementation in Java. It looks a lot like my <a
href="/blog/2007/10/08/">maze generator/solver</a> on the inside,
reflecting the way I think about these things. Gavin wrote a <a
href="http://devrand.org/show_item.html?item=98&amp;page=Project">
competing version of the game</a> in <a
href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> which we were partially
discussing the other night, so I made my own.
</p>
<p>
The individual cells are actually objects themselves, so you could
inherit the abstract Cell class and drop in your own rules. I bet you
could even write a Cell that does the <a href="/blog/2007/11/06/">
iterated prisoner's dilemma cellular automata</a>. The Cell objects
are wired together into a sort of mesh network. Instead of growing it
wraps around on the sides.
</p>
<p>
It takes up to four arguments right now, with three types of cells,
<code>basic</code>, implementing the basic Conway's Game of Life,
<code>growth</code>, which is a cell that matures over time, and
<code>random</code> which mixes both types together (seen in the
screenshot). The arguments work as follows,
</p>
<pre>
java -jar GoL.jar [&lt;cell type&gt; [&lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt; [&lt;cell pixel width&gt;]]]
</pre>
<p>
I may look into extending this to do some things beyond simple
cellular automata.
