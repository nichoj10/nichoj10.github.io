<p>
During my recent Elisp hacking I've run into the situation enough
times where I really wanted function composition that I officially
implemented it for myself. While there is
an <a href="/blog/2010/09/29/"> <code>apply-partially</code></a>
function, Elisp does not currently come with a <code>compose</code>
function. Here's an Elisp definition,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;; ID: f0c736a9-afec-3e3f-455c-40997023e130
(defun compose (&rest funs)
  "Return function composed of FUNS."
  (lexical-let ((lex-funs funs))
    (lambda (&rest args)
      (reduce 'funcall (butlast lex-funs)
              :from-end t
              :initial-value (apply (car (last lex-funs)) args)))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Here it is in action with three functions.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(funcall (compose 'prin1-to-string 'random* 'exp) 10)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
I'll be using this in later posts (and linking back here when I do).
</p>
