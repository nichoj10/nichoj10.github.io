<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding">Live coding</a> (or
livecoding) is software development as a performance art. A
programmer's screen is viewed by the audience and a program is written
and modified so that it produces sound and maybe even visual
effects. The audience gets to see the code and its effects live. I'm
not sure if "live" refers to the audience, the editing of live code,
or maybe both. There are videos all over the web of this in action so
if you haven't seen it yet do a quick search and watch one.
</p>
<p>
It's fairly easy to obtain livecoding software. For example,
there's <a href="http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/"> Fluxus</a>, which
extends PLT Scheme to support livecoding.
</p>
<p>
I've never done livecoding myself, but something I've noticed is that
Scheme seems to be a popular choice of language for livecoding. I
think I know how and why this is. Scheme, being a Lisp dialect, is
naturally
a <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html">
living system</a>: it can be modified and extended while it's actively
running. Scheme in particular is very well suited for the task thanks
to its simplicity and optimized tail recursion.
</p>
<p>
I'll do a little text-based livecoding example in PLT Scheme to show
how it works. This will be easier to do yourself if your text editor
can interact directly with a REPL (like Emacs or DrScheme).
</p>
<p>
Let's define a function that prints a line of text to the screen and
recurses, so that it continues printing forever. The recursion is
important here and I'll get back to it. To keep things manageable I'm
also going to insert a 1 second pause.
</p>
{% highlight scheme %}
(define (print-str)
  (display "Hello!\n")
  (sleep 1)
  (print-str))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
If we call this function with <code>(print-str)</code> it will sit
there printing "Hello!" over and over. It will also lock up our REPL
preventing us from doing anything else. Not very useful. So let's put
it in a thread instead!
</p>
{% highlight scheme %}
(thread print-str)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now our program is running and we get to keep our REPL. Why do we need
to keep our REPL alive? Well, so we can
redefine <code>print-str</code> on the fly! In my buffer I'll go back
and change "Hello!" to "Goodbye!". While I'm doing this the function
is still spitting out "Hello!".
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define (print-str)
  (display "Goodbye!\n")
  (sleep 1)
  (print-str))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
As soon as I tell my editor to pass this to the REPL
the <code>print-str</code> function gets redefined and starts printing
"Goodbye!" instead. Why did the running function change? Because of
recursion. When it called itself, it actually called the new
definition.
</p>
<p>
Since I didn't keep a handle on the thread the easiest way to
stop <code>print-str</code> from running is to redefine it without
recursion.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define (print-str)
  (display "Done.\n"))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
And it's done. If I was really fast about this my output looks
something like this.
</p><pre>
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Done.
</pre>
<p>
That's the fundamental workings of livecoding in Scheme: I changed a
program while it was running. To turn the above into the more
interesting livecoding you see in the videos all we need are some
audio and visual bindings (which is the hard part of it all).
