There was some concern in the latest Debian newsletter about a
[decrease in the bug reporting rate][decrease]. It could be
[signaling a decrease in momentum for Debian][activity]. Even worse,
this is actually part of a [6-year trend][6-year].

This has me a little concerned. Debian is an amazing project and it's
responsible for so much of my productivity. It truly is *the*
universal operating system. No other (non-Debian-derivative)
distribution, or operating system in general, comes close, in my
opinion.

Fortunately this is only one [of many statistics][popcon], and
observing bug reports is rather indirect. The other indicators say
things are healthy and growing. I suspect that the core packages that
most users have installed have matured over the years so that the bugs
are fewer and less severe. I also suspect that because Ubuntu has
attracted a lot of users, many bugs that would have been reported
against Debian are instead reported to Launchpad, without falling
through into Debian's system.

I wanted to take a look at the data myself, so, using the
[Debbugs SOAP interface][soap], I grabbed all of the bug report
timestamps for all bugs from 1 to 690000 (where they exist). Here is
that data. The first column is bug number and the second is the unix
epoch timestamp.

Using GNU Octave I worked out a histogram and plot with 1-day bins. My
curve fit is a bit more optimistic than Don Armstrong's. However, I
also have no idea what I'm doing,

There was a peak 6 years ago, but things have recently plateaued â€”
except for very recently with the Wheezy freeze (June 2012), which is
expected. If you have any insight on this, please share.
