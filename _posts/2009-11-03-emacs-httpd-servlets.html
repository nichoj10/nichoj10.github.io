<p>
Remember that <a href="/blog/2009/05/17/">Emacs web server I wrote</a>
back in May? Well, I got an e-mail last night from Chunye Wang
containing a patch with a variant of my dynamic lisp idea, called
"servlets" (not to be confused with Java servlets). Chunye had similar
concept for an Emacs web server for a long time, but never implemented
because Emacs lacked network functionality until recently
(Specifically, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.22.1">
<code>make-network-process</code></a> in Emacs 22.1, June 2007). This
led Chunye to find my implementation.
</p>
<p>
Again, you can clone/view the code here. I turned the patch into a
series of commits,
</p>
<pre>
git clone <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-http-server">git://github.com/skeeto/emacs-http-server.git</a>
</pre>
<p>
This is some cool stuff here.
</p>
<p>
The servlets are simply functions installed under an
"<code>httpd/</code>" namespace, where the trailing slash represents
the server root. So, the function <code>httpd/example-servlet</code>
will be executed when "/example-servlet" is requested from the
server. The servlet runs on a temporary buffer, whose contents are
served when the servlet function returns.
</p>
<p>
To assist in HTML generation, Chunye also wrote a function to turn an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>
into HTML, similar to the one I described in the web server previous
post. Symbols are converted into strings, alists are attributes, and
the <code>elisp</code> symbol indicates code to be executed, and the
results used to generate HTML. For a simple hello word,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(html (head (title "hello world")) (body "hello world"))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
And for some dynamic content, a die roller,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun httpd/roll-die (uri-query req uri-path)
  "Rolls a die with the requested number of sides (default 6)."
  (let ((sides
         (1- (string-to-number (or (cadr (assoc "sides" uri-query)) "6")))))
    (httpd-generate-html
     '(html
       (head
        (title "Die Roll Servlet"))
       (body
        (h1 "Die Roll Servlet")
        "You rolled a "
        (b
         (elisp (list (number-to-string (1+ (random sides)))))))))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
That one would be accessed from the browser with with
"<code>/roll-die</code>" or "<code>/roll-die?sides=100</code>".
</p>
<p>
Chunye provided some sample servlets that list the buffers, with links
that serve them up. There is also another servlet that will switch the
current buffer, which I find compelling. All of Emacs' functionality
is available to the servlet.
</p>
<p>
Now, to write a servlet that runs the Emacs psychiatrist ...
