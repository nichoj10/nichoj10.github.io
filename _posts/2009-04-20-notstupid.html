<!-- 20 April 2009 -->
<p>
I was reading through a website of
"<a href="http://www.rinkworks.com/stupid/cs_programming.shtml">computer
stupidities</a>" today when I came across this,
</p>
{% highlight c %}
if (a)
  {
    /* do something */
    return x;
  }
else if (!a)
  {
    /* do something else */
    return y;
  }
else
  {
    /* do something entirely different */
    return z;
  }
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This was quickly dismissed as being an obvious beginner mistake. I
don't think this can be dismissed so quickly without thinking it
through for a moment. Yes, in the example above we will never reach
the last condition where we <code>return z</code>, but consider the
following,
</p>
{% highlight c %}
if (a < b)
  printf ("foo\n");
else if (a > b)
  printf ("bar\n");
else if (a == b)
  printf ("baz\n");
else
  printf ("faz\n");
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The same quick dismissal might drop the last "faz" print statement as
being an impossible condition. Can you think of a situation where the
program would print "faz"?
</p>
<p>
Our final condition will be reached if <code>a</code> or
<code>b</code> is equal to <code>NAN</code>, which is defined by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating-point_standard">
IEEE floating-point standard</a>. It is available in C99 from
<code>math.h</code>. A <code>NAN</code> in any of the comparisons
above will evaluate to false.
</p>
<p>
So don't be so quick to dismiss code like this.
