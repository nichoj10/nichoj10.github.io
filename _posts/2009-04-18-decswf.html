Flash seems to be the popular way of playing videos online. This is a
bit better than the bad old days of online video where a user had to
select from a few buggy media player plug-ins. Things have improved.
</p>
<p>
However, if you don't use Flash, or if you want to watch the videos in
your own media player, you are stuck. A download link for the video is
almost never provided. The video is always somewhere, though, to be
fetched via http. I <a href="/blog/2007/09/05">mentioned this
before</a> for downloading YouTube videos using <a
href="http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/"> youtube-dl</a>.
</p>
<p>
The trick is finding the URL. Sometimes you can derive it from the
HTML code, sometimes you have to dig a little deeper by inspecting the
Flash player itself. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_(Unix)"><code>
strings</code></a> can be invaluable here.
</p>
<p>
There could be an extra layer of stuff to work out, which is explained
below. My main reason for posting this is so I can refer back to it
later when I need to do it again.
</p>
<p>
So, the other day I ran into a Flash video player that contained part
of the URL of its video. I began by studying the <code>embed</code>
tag in the HTML, which gave me some information about where to find
the video (the video ID number). I downloaded the Flash player SWF
file for the purpose of running <code>strings</code> on it.
</p>
<p>
I ran into a problem here. I wasn't finding any non-garbage strings
inside the file. <code>file</code> told me it was <i>compressed</i>.
</p>
<pre>
$ file player.swf
player.swf: Macromedia Flash data (compressed), version 9
</pre>
<p>
Searching online quickly revealed that a compressed Flash file is just
zlib compression after an 8-byte header. Decompression can actually be
done with a Perl one-liner,
</p>
<pre>
perl -MCompress::Zlib -0777 -e \
      'print uncompress substr &lt;&gt;, 8;' player.swf &gt; player
</pre>
<p>
I ran <code>strings</code> and <code>grep</code>ed for "http",
revealing the location of the video. That was it!
</p>
<p>
I actually came across <a
href="http://www.brooksandrus.com/blog/2006/08/10/"> a Java program
</a> that does the same thing. It is 115 lines of code. Java programs
always seem to be bloated like this.
</p>
<p>
I hope you find this useful!
