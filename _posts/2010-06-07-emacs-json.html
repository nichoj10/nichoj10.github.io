A printed hash table representation is pretty new to Elisp, and a bit
late. As far as I know Elisp didn't come with a way to print, and read
back in, a hash table without rolling your own
(like <a href="http://curiousprogrammer.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/data-dumper-in-emacs-lisp/">
Jared Dilettante was doing with a Data::Dumper style output</a>),
until 23.1 in July 2009. This is
when <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1">
<code>json.el</code> was first included with Emacs</a>, for dumping to
and reading from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
(require 'json)

(setq hash (make-hash-table))
(puthash "key1" "data1" hash)
(puthash "key2" "data2" hash)

(insert "\n;; " (json-encode hash))
;; {"key2":"data2", "key1":"data1"}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Just a month ago Emacs 23.2 came out, very silently
including <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.2">a new
printed representation for hash tables</a> with a <code>#s</code> hash
notation.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
#s(hash-table data ("key1" "data1" "key2" "data2"))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
With this hash tables can be printed and read as part of normal
s-expressions with the standard lisp reader and printer functions.  It
seems heavy, having to write out "<code>hash-table</code>" in there,
but I think it's because the <code>#s</code> notation will be used to
create printed forms of other lisp objects that currently do not have
one.
