<p>
I converted this website to HTML 5 from its original XHTML 1.0
Transitional. Because I was already valid, it was actually pretty
easy. Well, I first converted it to XHTML 1.0 Strict by shifting some
things into CSS that should have been that way in the first place
(results of laziness). Then when that validated I just changed the
DOCTYPE to HTML 5, added a new<code> meta</code> tag, checked
<i>that</i> validation and that was it. Really simple.
</p>
<p>
One of the main reasons was so that I could use the new
<code>video</code> tag. From now on any posts with videos will display
them as in-line videos (Ogg Vorbis), provided you are using a browser
with HTML 5 support. In fact, I already did it with two older posts:
<a href="/blog/2009/05/27">Knight's Tour</a> and the <a
href="/blog/2007/10/01">Mandelbrot set zoom videos</a>.
</p>
<p>
HTML 5 is still a moving target, so I <i>may</i> have to do some
keeping up over time. Probably not.
</p>
<p>
Video is finally a first class web citizen and it is quite exciting.
