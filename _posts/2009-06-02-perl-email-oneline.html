<p>
If you look at the page sources around here you might notice that
there are no bare e-mail addresses around. This is because I obfuscate
them into a series of HTML entities. So far this has been pretty
effective at hiding from address-scraping, web-crawling spam
bots. They don't seem to try very hard at decoding HTML entities.

<p>
When I added the comment system, I needed to obfuscate addresses
automatically. I quickly realized that this is yet another perl
one-liner (and implemented as one line in the comment system). It can
be used on the command line to obfuscate a file/pipe containing a list
of addresses.

{% highlight bash %}
perl -lpe '$_ = join "", map {"&#" . ord() . ";"} split //'
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
All of the spaces are really only there for us humans,
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
perl -lpe '$_=join"",map{"&#".ord.";"}split//'
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
I keep running into these one-liners.
