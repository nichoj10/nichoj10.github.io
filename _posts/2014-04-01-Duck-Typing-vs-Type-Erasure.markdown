Consider the following C++ class.

~~~c++
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
struct Caller {
  const T callee_;
  Caller(const T callee) : callee_(callee) {}
  void go() { callee_.call(); }
};
~~~

Caller can be parameterized to *any* type so long as it has a `call()`
method. For example, introduce two types, Foo and Bar.

~~~c++
struct Foo {
  void call() const { std::cout << "Foo"; }
};

struct Bar {
  void call() const { std::cout << "Bar"; }
};

int main() {
  Caller<Foo> foo{Foo()};
  Caller<Bar> bar{Bar()};
  foo.go();
  bar.go();
  std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
~~~

This code compiles cleanly and, when run, emits "FooBar". This is an
example of *duck typing* â€” i.e., "If it looks like a duck, swims like
a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck." Foo and
Bar are unrelated types. They have no common inheritance, but by
providing the expected interface, they both work with with Caller.
This is a special case of *polymorphism*.

Duck typing is normally only found in dynamically typed languages.
Thanks to templates, a statically, strongly typed language like C++
can have duck typing without sacrificing any type safety.

### Java Duck Typing

Let's try the same thing in Java using generics.

~~~java
class Caller<T> {
    final T callee;
    Caller(T callee) {
        this.callee = callee;
    }
    public void go() {
        callee.call();  // compiler error: cannot find symbol call
    }
}

class Foo {
    public void call() { System.out.print("Foo"); }
}

class Bar {
    public void call() { System.out.print("Bar"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Caller<Foo> f = new Caller<>(new Foo());
        Caller<Bar> b = new Caller<>(new Bar());
        f.go();
        b.go();
        System.out.println();
    }
}
~~~

The program is practically identical, but this will fail with a
compile-time error. This is the result of *type erasure*. Unlike C++'s
templates, there will only ever be one compiled version of Caller, and
T will become Object. Since Object has no `call()` method, compilation
fails. The generic type is only for enabling additional compiler
checks later on.

C++ templates behave like a macros, expanded by the compiler once for
each different type of applied parameter. The `call` symbol is looked
up later, after the type has been fully realized, not when the
template is defined.

To fix this, Foo and Bar need a common ancestry. Let's make this
`Callee`.

~~~java
interface Callee {
    void call();
}
~~~

Caller needs to be redefined such that T is a subclass of Callee.

~~~java
class Caller<T extends Callee> {
    // ...
}
~~~

This now compiles cleanly because `call()` will be found in `Callee`.
Finally, implement Callee.

~~~java
class Foo implements Callee {
    // ...
}

class Bar implements Callee {
    // ...
}
~~~

This is no longer duck typing, just plain old polymorphism. Type
erasure prohibits duck typing in Java (outside of dirty reflection
hacks).

### Signals and Slots and Events! Oh My!

Duck typing is useful for implementing the observer pattern without as
much boilerplate. A class can participate in the observer pattern
without [inheriting from some specialized class][hier] or interface.
For example, see [the various signal and slots systems for C++][sns].
In constrast, Java [has an EventListener type for everything][events]:

* KeyListener
* MouseListener
* MouseMotionListener
* FocusListener
* ActionListener, etc.

A class concerned with many different kinds of events, such as an
event logger, would need to inherit a large number of interfaces.
