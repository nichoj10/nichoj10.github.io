<p>
I've been using lisp on and off for the past few years. I read some
lisp books, went through <a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/"><i>The Little
Schemer</i></a> and some of <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a>. But
I could never really <i>think</i> in lisp. When I needed to write some
code, I would prefer another language first. I was writing imperative
code for 10 years before I saw lisp, and I was used to it.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I have found myself wanting to use lists (including alists,
plists, etc.) as data structures for everything, even when I'm not
even writing lisp. I think I finally
<i>got</i> lisp and now I want to use lisp for everything.
</p>
<p>
For example, take this little problem from the other day on <a
href="http://function-of-time.blogspot.com/">f(t)</a>. <a
href="http://function-of-time.blogspot.com/2009/05/wait-what.html">
Katie Nowak gives us a math problem</a>,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    There is a 75% chance of rain on any given day in the next
    week. What is the probability that it will rain on at least 5 of
    the 7 days?
  </p>

The purpose of the question was to point out a neat coincidence in the
problem (explained at the link). I used a program to solve the
problem and there are two reasons for this.
</p>
<p>
First, I wanted to use the program to explore the problem and find the
"special" property. With a program, I could quickly try different
parameters, which would take longer, and be more error prone, by hand.
</p>
<p>
Second, which is similar to the first, I hate evaluating a large
expression by hand. It's slow and error prone. Writing a program to do
the same work is faster and mistakes are easier to catch. Also, I can
quickly try different parameters to make sure my program's output is
reasonable. In this case, for any reasonable input, the output, a
probability, shouldn't be greater than 1.
</p>
<p>
Well, let's see, this is a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process"> Bernoulli
experiment</a>: each day is independent, so it is like flipping a coin
seven times and counting the heads. That means we need the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient"> <i>choose
function</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
My first thought was Octave, as this is a simple program and Octave
already provides <code>nchoosek()</code> for me.
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
# Rain at least n days
function sum = rain (n)
  sum = 0;
  for i = n:7
    sum += nchoosek(7,i) * 0.75 ^ i * 0.25 ^ (7 - i);
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Simple, but I actually made a couple little mistakes working it out,
and it took me a little longer than it should have. If you asked
someone to write this program in any imperative language, it would
probably look a lot like this.
</p>
<p>
I then made a lisp version (elisp), but I first needed to define the
binomial coefficient function since there wasn't one provided.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun nck (n k)
  "The binomial coefficient."
  (if (or (= k 0) (= k n)) 1
    (+ (nck (- n 1) (- k 1)) (nck (- n 1) k))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This is the recursive version, based on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_rule"> Pascal's
rule</a>, so it doesn't need factorials.
</p>
<p>
In lisp, recursion is preferred to iteration, so that's the way I
approached the program.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun p-rain (n)
  "Probability of rain on exactly n days."
  (* (nck 7 n) (expt 0.75 n) (expt 0.25 (- 7 n))))

(defun rain-at-least (n)
  "Probability it will rain on at least n days."
  (if (> n 7) 0
    (+ (p-rain n) (rain-at-least (+ 1 n)))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
I like the recursive version, and this code, much better. It presents
the solution in a more straight forward way.  And I got it right the
first time, too. Yes, it <i>was</i> written after the Octave version,
but I still think it counts for something.
</p>
<p>
The lisp version is also less complex. The Octave version has to use
some temporary variables, <code>i</code> and <code>sum</code>, which
is extra conceptual overhead. Sure, it could also be written
recursively, but this is not really the way Octave is meant to be
written.
</p>
<p>
Eh, not a great example, really. Lisp has so many powerful features,
like macros (the powerful lisp kind), symbols, low-level access into
the interpreter, and the REPL, that allow the programmer to do some
really cool things. Many of these features are unique to lisps.
</p>
<p>
I'm really liking lisp.
