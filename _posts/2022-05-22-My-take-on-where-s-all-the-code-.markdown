*This article was discussed [on Lobsters][rs].*

Earlier this month Ted Unangst researched [compiling the OpenBSD kernel
50% faster][fast], which involved stubbing out the largest, extraneous
branches of the source tree. To find the lowest-hanging fruit, he [wrote a
tool][post] called [watc][] — *where's all the code* — that displays an
interactive "usage" summary of a source tree oriented around line count. A
followup post [about exploring the tree in parallel][par] got me thinking
about the problem, especially since [I had just written about a concurrent
queue][q]. Turning it over in my mind, I saw opportunities for interesting
data structures and memory management, and so I wanted to write my own
version of the tool, [**`watc.c`**][src], which is the subject of this
article.

<!--more-->

The original `watc` is interactive and written in idiomatic Go. My version
is non-interactive, written in C, and currently only supports Windows. Not
only do I prefer batch programs generally, building an interactive user
interface would be complicated and distract from the actual problem I
wanted to tackle. As for the platform restriction, it has some convenient
constraints (for implementers), and my projects are often about shooting
multiple birds with one stone:

* The longest path is `MAX_PATH`, a meager 260 pseudo-UTF-16 code points,
  is nice and short. Technically users can now opt-in to a [maximum path
  length of 32,767][max], but so little software supports it, including
  much of Windows itself, that it's not worth considering. Even with the
  upper limit, each path component is still restricted by `MAX_PATH`. I
  can rely on this platform restriction in my design.

* Symbolic links, an annoying edge case, are outside of consideration.
  Technically Windows has them, but they're sufficiently locked away that
  they don't come up in practice.

* After years of deliberating, I [was finally convinced][cm] to buy and
  try [RememdyBG][db], a super slick Windows debugger. I especially wanted
  to try out its multi-threading support, and I knew I'd be using multiple
  threads in this project. Since it's incompatible with [my development
  kit][w64], my program also supports the MSVC compiler.

* The very same day I [improved GDB support][gdb] in my development kit,
  and this was a great opportunity to dogfood the changes. I've used my
  kit *so much* these past two years, especially since both it and I have
  matured enough that I'm nearly as productive in it as I am on Linux.

* It's practice and experience with [the wide API][wide], and the tool
  fully supports Unicode paths. Perhaps a bit unnecessary considering how
  few source trees stray beyond ASCII, even just in source text — just too
  many ways things go wrong otherwise.

Running my tool on nearly the same source tree as the original example
yields:

In place of interactivity it has `-n` (lines) and `-d` (depth) switches to
control tree pruning, where branches are summarized as `(other)` entries.
My idea is for users to run the tool repeatedly with different cutoffs and
filters to get a feel for *where's all the code*. (It could really use
more such knobs.) Repeated counting makes performance all the more
important. On my machine, and a hot cache, the above takes ~180ms to count
those 6.89 million lines of code across 8,607 source files.

Each directory is treated like one big source file of its recursively
concatenated contents, so the tool only needs to track directories. Each
directory entry comprises a variable-length string name, line and byte
totals, and tree linkage such that it can be later navigated for sorting
and printing. That linkage has a clever solution, which I'll get to later.
First, lets deal with strings.

### String management

It's important to get out of the null-terminated string business early,
only reverting to their use at system boundaries, such as constructing
paths for the operating system. Better to handle strings as offset/length
pairs into a buffer. Definitely avoid silly things like [allocating many
individual strings][alloc], as encouraged by `strdup` — and most other
programming language idioms — and certainly avoid [useless functions like
`strcpy`][cpy].

When the operating system provides a path component that I need to track
for later, I intern it into a single, large buffer. That buffer looks like
so:

```c
#define BUF_MAX  (1 << 22)
struct buf {
    int32_t len;
    wchar_t buf[BUF_MAX];
};
```

Empirically I determined that even large source trees cumulatively total
on the order of 10,000 characters of directory names. The OpenBSD kernel
source tree is only 2,992 characters of names.

    $ find sys -type d -printf %f | wc -c
    2992

The biggest I found was the LLVM source tree at 121,720 characters, not
only because of its sheer volume but also because it has generally has
relatively long names. So for my maximum buffer size I just maxed it out
(explained in a moment) and called it good. Even with UTF-16, that's only
8MiB which is perfectly reasonable to allocate all at once up front. Since
my [string handles][h] don't contain pointers, this buffer could be freely
relocated in the case of `realloc`.

The operating system provides a null-terminated string. The buffer makes a
copy and returns a handle. A handle is a 32-bit integer encoding offset
and length.

```c
int32_t buf_push(struct buf *b, wchar_t *s)
{
    int32_t off = b->len;
    int32_t len = wcslen(s);
    if (b->len+len > BUF_MAX) {
        return -1;  // out of memory
    }
    memcpy(b->buf+off, s, len*sizeof(*s));
    b->len += len;
    return len<<22 | off;
}
```

The negative range is reserved for errors, leaving 31 bits. I allocate 9
to the length — enough for `MAX_PATH` of 260 — and the remaining 22 bits
for the buffer offset, exactly matching the range of my `BUF_MAX`.
Splitting on a nibble boundary would have displayed more nicely in
hexadecimal during debugging, but oh well.

A couple of helper functions are in order:

```c
int     str_len(int32_t s) { return s >> 22;      }
int32_t str_off(int32_t s) { return s & 0x3fffff; }
```

Rather than allocate the string buffer on the heap, it's a `static` (read:
too big for the stack) scoped to `main`. I consistently call it `b`.

```c
static struct buf b;
```

That's string management solved efficiently in a dozen lines of code. I
briefly considered a hash table to de-duplicate strings in the buffer, but
real source trees aren't redundant enough to make up for the hash table
itself, plus there's no reason here to make that sort of time/memory
trade-off.

### Directory entries

I settled on 24-byte directory entries:

```c
struct dir {
    uint64_t nbytes;
    uint32_t nlines;
    int32_t  name;
    int32_t  link;
    int32_t  nsubdirs;
};
```

For `nbytes` I teetered between 32 bits and 64 bits for the byte count. No
source tree I found overflows an unsigned 32-bit integer, but LLVM comes
close, just barely overflowing a signed 31-bit integer as of this year.
Since I wanted 10x over the worst case I could find, that left me with a
64-bit integer for bytes.

For `nlines`, 32 bits has plenty of overhead. More importantly, this field
is updated concurrently and atomically by multiple threads — line counting
is parallelized — and I want this program to work on 32-bit hosts limited
to 32-bit atomics.

The `name` is the string handle for that directory's name.

The `link` and `nsubdirs` is the tree linkage. The `link` field is an
index, and serves two different purposes at different times. Initially it
will identify the directory's parent directory, and I had originally named
it `parent`. `nsubdirs` is the number of subdirectories, but there is
initially no link to a directory's children.

Like with the buffer, I pre-allocate all the directory entries I'll need:

```c
#define DIRS_MAX  (1 << 17)
int32_t ndirs = 0;
static struct dir dirs[DIRS_MAX];
```

A directory handle is just an index into `dirs`. The `link` field is one
such handle. Like string handles, directory entries contain no pointers,
and so this `dirs` buffer could be freely relocated, *a la* `realloc`, if
the context called for such flexibility. In my program, rather than
allocate this on the heap, it's just a `static` (read: too big for the
stack) scoped to `main`.

For `DIRS_MAX`, I again looked at the worst case I could find, LLVM, which
requires 12,163 entries. I had hoped for 16-bit directory handles, but
that would limit source trees to 32,768 directories — not quite 10x over
the worst case. I settled on 131,072 entries: 3MiB. At only 11MiB total so
far, in the very worst case, it hardly matters that I couldn't shave off
these extra few bytes.

    $ find llvm-project -type d | wc -l
    12163

Allocating a directory entry is just a matter of bumping the `ndirs`
counter. Reading a directory into `dirs` looks roughly like so:

```c
int32_t glob = buf_push(&b, L"*");
static struct dir dirs[DIRS_MAX];

int32_t parent = ...;  // an existing directory handle
wchar_t path[MAX_PATH];
buildpath(path, &b, dirs, parent, glob);

WIN32_FIND_DATAW fd;
HANDLE h = FindFirstFileW(path, &fd);

do {
    if (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY & fd.dwFileAttributes) {
        int32_t name = buf_push(&b, fd.cFileName);
        if (name < 0 || ndirs == DIRS_MAX) {
            // out of memory
        }
        int32_t i = ndirs++;
        dirs[i].name = name;
        dirs[i].link = parent;
        dirs[parent].nsubdirs++;
    } else {
        // ... process file ...
    }
} while (FindNextFileW(h, &fd));

CloseHandle(h);
```

Mentally bookmark that "process file" part. It will be addressed later.

The `buildpath` function walks the `link` fields, copying (`memcpy`) path
components from the string buffer into the `path`, separated by
backslashes.

### Breadth-first tree traversal

At the top-level the program must first traverse a tree. There are two
strategies for traversing a tree (or any graph):

* Depth-first: stack-oriented (lends to recursion)
* Breadth-first: queue-oriented

Recursion makes me nervous, but besides this, a queue is already a natural
fit for this problem. The tree I build in `dirs` is also the breadth-first
processing queue. (Note: This is entirely distinct from the *message*
queue that I'll introduce later, and is not a concurrent queue.) Further,
building the tree in `dirs` via breadth-first traversal will have useful
properties later.

The queue is initialized with the root directory, then iterated over until
the iterator reaches the end. Additional directories may added during
iteration, per the last section.

```c
int32_t root = ndirs++;
dirs[root].name = buf_push(&b, L".");
dirs[root].link = -1;  // terminator

for (int32_t parent = 0; parent < ndirs; parent++) {
    // ... FindFirstFileW / FindNextFileW ...
}
```

When the loop exits, the program has traversed the full tree. Counts are
now propagated up the tree using the `link` field, pointing from leaves to
root. In this direction it's just a linked list. Propagation starts at the
root and works towards leaves to avoid multiple-counting, and the
breadth-first `dirs` is already ordered for this.

```c
for (int32_t i = 1; i < ndirs; i++) {
    for (int32_t j = dirs[i].link; j >= 0; j = dirs[j].link) {
        dirs[j].nbytes += dirs[i].nbytes;
        dirs[j].nlines += dirs[i].nlines;
    }
}
```

Since this is really another traversal, this could be done during the
first traversal. However, line counting will be done concurrently, and
it's easier, and probably more efficient, to propagate concurrent results
after the concurrent part of the code is complete.

### Inverting the tree links

Printing the graph will require a depth-first traversal. Given an entry,
the program will iterate over its children. However, the tree links are
currently backwards, pointing from child to parent:

[![](/img/diagram/bfs0.png)](/img/diagram/bfs0.dot)

To traverse from root to leaves, those links will need to be inverted:

[![](/img/diagram/bfs1.png)](/img/diagram/bfs1.dot)

However, there's only one `link` on each node, but potentially multiple
children. The breadth-first traversal comes to the rescue: All child nodes
for a given directory are adjacent in `dirs`. If `link` points to the
first child, finding the rest is trivial. There's an implicit link between
siblings by virtue of position:

[![](/img/diagram/bfs2.png)](/img/diagram/bfs2.dot)

An entry's first child immediately follows the previous entry's last
child. So to flip the links around, manually establish the root's `link`
field, then walk the tree breadth-first and hook `link` up to each entry's
children based on the previous entry's `link` and `nsubdirs`:

```c
dirs[0].link = 1;
for (int32_t i = 1; i < ndirs; i++) {
    dirs[i].link = dirs[i-1].link + dirs[i-1].nsubdirs;
}
```

The tree is now restructured for sorting and depth-first traversal.

### Sort by line count

I won't include it here, but I have a `qsort`-compatible comparison
function, `dircmp` that compares by line count descending, then by name
ascending. As a file system tree, siblings cannot have equal names.

```c
int dircmp(const void *, const void *);
```

Since child entries are adjacent, it's a trivial to `qsort` each entry's
children. A loop sorts the whole tree:

```c
for (int32_t i = 0; i < ndirs; i++) {
    struct dir *beg = dirs + dirs[i].link;
    qsort(beg, dirs[i].nsubdirs, sizeof(*dirs), dircmp);
}
```

We're almost to the finish line.

### Depth-first traversal

As I said, recursion makes me nervous, so I took the slightly more
complicated route of an explicit stack. Path components must be separated
by a backslash delimiter, so the deepest possible stack is `MAX_PATH/2`.
Each stack element tracks a directory handle (`d`) and a subdirectory
index (`i`).

I have a `printstat` to output an entry. It takes an entry, the string
buffer, and a depth for indentation level.

```c
void printstat(struct dir *d, struct buf *b, int depth);
```

Here's a simplified depth-first traversal calling `printstat`. (The real
one has to make decisions about when to stop and summarize, and it's
dominated by edge cases.) I initialize the stack with the root directory,
then loop until it's empty.

```c
int n = 0;  // top of stack
struct {
    int32_t d;
    int32_t i;
} stack[MAX_PATH/2];

stack[n].d = 0;
stack[n].i = 0;
printstat(dirs+0, &b, n);

while (n >= 0) {
    int32_t d = stack[n].d;
    int32_t i = stack[n].i++;
    if (i >= dirs[d].nsubdirs) {
        n--;  // pop
    } else {
        int32_t cur = dirs[d].link + i;
        printstat(dirs+cur, &b, n);
        n++;  // push
        stack[n].d = cur;
        stack[n].i = 0;
    }
}
```

### Concurrency

At this point the "process file" part of traversal was a straightforward
`CreateFile`, `ReadFile` loop, `CloseHandle`. I suspected it spent most of
its time in the loop counting newlines since I didn't do anything special,
[like SIMD][simd], aside from [not over-constraining code
generation][chunk].

However after taking some measurements, I found the program was spending
99.9% its time waiting on Win32 functions. `CreateFile` was the most
expensive at nearly 50% of the total run time, and even `CloseHandle` was
a substantial blocker. These two alone meant overlapped I/O wouldn't help
much, and threads were necessary to run these Win32 blockers concurrently.
Counting newlines, even over gigabytes of data, was practically free, and
so required no further attention.

So I set up [my lock-free work queue][q].

```c
#define QUEUE_LEN (1<<15)
struct queue {
    uint32_t q;
    int32_t d[QUEUE_LEN];
    int32_t f[QUEUE_LEN];
};
```

As before, `q` here is the atomic. A max-size queue for `QUEUE_LEN` worked
best in my tests. Larger queues were rarely full. Or empty, except at
startup and shutdown. Queue elements are a pair of directory handle (`d`)
and file string handle (`f`), stored in separate arrays.

I didn't need to push the file name strings into the string buffer before,
but now it's a great way to supply strings to other threads. I push the
string into the buffer, then send the handle through the queue. The
recipient re-constructs the path on its end using the directory tree and
this file name. Unfortunately this puts more stress on the string buffer,
which is why I had to max out the size, but it's worth it.

The "process files" part now looks like this:

```c
dirs[parent].nbytes += fd.nFileSizeLow;
dirs[parent].nbytes += (uint64_t)fd.nFileSizeHigh << 32;

int32_t name = buf_push(&b, fd.cFileName);
if (!queue_send(&queue, parent, name)) {
    wchar_t path[MAX_PATH];
    buildpath(path, buf.buf, dirs, parent, name);
    processfile(path, dirs, parent);
}
```

If `queue_send()` returns false then the queue is full, so it processes
the job itself. There might be room later for the next file.

Worker threads look similar, spinning until an item arrives in the queue:

```c
    for (;;) {
        int32_t d;
        int32_t name;
        while (!queue_recv(q, &d, &name));
        if (d == -1) {
            return 0;
        }
        wchar_t path[MAX_PATH];
        buildpath(path, buf, dirs, d, name);
        processfile(path, dirs, d);
    }
```

A special directory entry handle of -1 tells the worker to exit. When
traversal completes, the main thread becomes a worker until the queue
empties, pushes one termination handle for each worker thread, then joins
the worker threads — a synchronization point that indicates all work is
complete, and the main thread can move on to propagation and sorting.

This was a substantial performance boost. At least on my system, running
just 4 threads total is enough to saturate the Win32 interface, and
additional threads do not make the program faster despite more available
cores.

Aside from overall portability, I'm quite happy with the results.
