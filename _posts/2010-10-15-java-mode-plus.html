There's an extension to Emacs
called <a href="http://jdee.sourceforge.net/"> JDEE</a> which tries to
turn Emacs into a heavyweight IDE for Java. I've never had any success
with it, and I don't know anyone else who has either. It's difficult
to set up, the dependencies are even worse, poorly documented, and
then it doesn't seem to work very well anyway. I think it's too
divorced from Emacs'
core <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability">
composable</a> functionality to be of much use. I may as well be using
a big IDE.
</p>
<p>
So, instead, as <a href="/blog/2009/12/06/">I've
posted</a> <a href="/blog/2010/09/30/">about</a>
<a href="/blog/2010/10/14/">over time</a>, I've started with the basic
Emacs Java functionality and tweaked my way up from there. I've
extended it enough that I decided to package it up on it's own, and
hopefully others will find it useful too. I call
it <code>java-mode-plus</code>!
</p>
<pre>
git clone <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-java">git://github.com/skeeto/emacs-java.git</a>
</pre>
<p>
Specifically: <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-java/blob/master/java-mode-plus.el">java-mode-plus.el</a>
</p>
<p>
It provides a hook into <code>java-mode</code> that creates a bunch of
new bindings. It also creates some new globally-available functions
like <code>open-java-project</code>. It's all heavily Ant-based since
that's what I like to use. It wouldn't be very hard to modify it to
use Maven, if that's what your thing.
</p>
<p>
<b>My very thorough documentation is in a large header comment in the
source file itself.</b> I cover my whole workflow from top to
bottom. If you're interested in making Emacs more Java-friendly take a
look at it. It's not a lot of code, but each line has been
thoughtfully added after hours and hours of Java development.
