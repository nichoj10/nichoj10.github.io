<!-- 21 July 2010 -->
<p>
I drew the <a href="/blog/2010/07/19/">magic space elevator</a> a few
days back after some practice. Here's my very first attempt at this
art style,
</p>
<p class="center">
  <video src="/vid/artwork/mountains.ogv" controls width="400" height="250"
         poster="/img/artwork/mountains.png">
    Your browser doesn't support HTML 5 and Ogg Vorbis. So here's the
    video file directly for download:
    <a href="/vid/artwork/mountains.ogv">mountains.ogv</a>
  </video><br/>
  <a href="/vid/artwork/mountains.ogv">Full Size Video</a>
</p>
<p>
And the image itself,
</p>
<p class="center">
  <a href="/img/artwork/mountains.png">
    <img src="/img/artwork/mountains-thumb.png" alt=""/>
  </a>
</p>
