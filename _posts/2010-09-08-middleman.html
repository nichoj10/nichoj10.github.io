<p>
I recently discovered a very clever tool
called <a href="http://mdm.berlios.de/usage.html">Middleman</a>. It's
a quick way to set up and manage multiple-process workload queue. The
process output and display is done inside of a screen session, so if
it's going to take awhile you can just detach and check on it again
later. In the past I used <code>make</code>'s <code>-j</code> option
to do this, but that's always a pain to set up.
</p>
<p>
It is composed of three
programs: <code>mdm.screen</code>, <code>mdm-run</code>,
and <code>mdm-sync</code>. The first is the top level supervisor that
you use to launch the enhanced shell script. The second prefixes every
command to be run in parallel. The third is prefixes the final command
that depends on all of the individual processes.
</p>
<p>
The linked Middleman page has a good example, but I'll share my own
anyway. I used it over the weekend to download a long series of videos
with <a href="http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/">
youtube-dl</a>. Because the transfer rate for a single video is
throttled I wanted to grab several at a time, but I also didn't want
to grab them <i>all</i> at the same time. Here's the dumb version of
the script, <code>download.sh</code>, that does them all at once.
</p>

#!/bin.sh
youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX0</i> &amp;

With Middleman all I had to do was this,
</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX0</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX1</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX2</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX3</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX4</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX5</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX6</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX7</i>
<b>mdm-run</b> youtube-dl -t http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<i>XXXXXXXXXX8</i>

<p>
Then just launch the script with <code>mdm.screen</code>. It defaults
to 6 processes at a time, but you can adjust it to whatever you want
with the <code>-n</code> switch. I used 4.
</p>
<pre>
$ mdm.screen -n 4 ./download.sh
</pre>
<p>
There is a screen window that lists the process queue and highlights
the currently active jobs. I could switch between screen windows to
see the output from individual processes and see how they were doing.
</p>
<p>
From the perspective of the shell script, the first four commands
finish instantly but fifth command will block. As soon as Middleman
sees one of the first four processes complete the fifth one will begin
work, returning control to the shell script, and the sixth command
will block, since the queue is full again.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure I'll be using this more in the future, especially for tasks
like batch audio and video encoding. I bet this could be useful on
a <a href="/blog/2007/09/17/">cluster</a>.
