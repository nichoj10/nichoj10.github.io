<p>
A co-worker asked me a question today about C/C++ pointers,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If a pointer is declared inside a function with no explicit
    initialization, can I assume that the pointer is initialized
    to <code>NULL</code>?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We were down in the lab and, therefore, he had no Internet access to
look it up himself, which is why he asked. When I code C, it is just a
sort of mental habit to not use a non-static function variable without
first initializing it, but is this accurate? I <i>knew</i> the answer
was "no", but I wanted to be able to explain the "why".
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I quickly recalled some of my experimental C programs and
thought carefully about the mechanics of what is going on
behind-the-scenes, allowing me to confidently give him a "no"
answer. I then threw this together in a few seconds to prove it,
</p>

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

void a ()
{
  int   * x = (int *) 0x012345FF;
  double  y = -63454;
  (void) x;
  (void) y;
}

void b ()
{
  int   * x;
  double  y;
  printf ("%p, %f\n", x, y);
}

int main ()
{
  a ();
  b ();
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
When you compile it, make sure you don't use the optimization options
(<code>-O</code>, <code>-O2</code>, or <code>-O3</code>
for <code>gcc</code>) because they change the inner-workings of the
program. It might do things like make those functions inline (so they
won't be on the stack as I am intending), or even toss
out <code>a()</code>, as it appears to do nothing. The compiler sees
that, even though I "used" variables in <code>a()</code> by casting
them to <code>void</code>, nothing is really happening,
so <code>a()</code> can be ignored. We can probably get around this
with a tacked
on <code> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_variable">
volatile</a></code> declaration, which you might see a lot of in a
micro-controller program. In a micro-controller, some memory addresses
are mapped to registers external to the software, so, from the
compiler's point of view, access to these locations may look like
nothing is really happening. Optimizing away variables that point to
these memory locations will lead to an incorrect binary, so your robot
or laser guided shark or whatever won't work.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, compiling with optimization will break my example! So don't do
it here.
</p>
<p>
When compiling, you should get some warnings about using uninitialized
variables, which is kind of the point of my example. Ignore it. That
warning alone gives away the answer to the main question, really, but
this example is a bit more fun!
</p>
<p>
Before you run it, study it and think about what the output should
look like. When <code>a()</code> is called, its stack frame goes into
the call stack, which contains the two declared variables. These
variables are then assigned as part of the function
execution. When <code>a()</code> returns, the frame is popped off the
stack. Then <code>b()</code> is called, and, as the variable
declarations are exactly the same, it will fit right over top
of <code>a()</code>'s old stack frame, and its variables will line
up. <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not assigned any value, so
they pick up whatever junk was lying around, which happens to be the
values assigned in <code>a()</code>.
</p>
<p>
When you run the program, this is the output,
</p>
<pre>
0x12345ff, -63454.000000
</pre>
<p>
The pointer is <i>not</i> initialized
to <code>NULL</code>. If <code>x</code> is passed back uninitialized
under the assumption that a <code>NULL</code> is being passed, some
other poor function that handles the return value may dereference it,
resulting in possibly
some <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html">
nasal demons</a>, but most likely an annoying segmentation
fault. Worse, this error may occur far, far away from where the actual
problem is, and even worse than that, only sometimes (depending on the
state of the call stack at just the right moment).
</p>
<p>
Note here that I am talking about non-static function variable
declarations. Global variables and static function variables will not
be on the stack. They are placed in a fixed location (in the data
segment), and their values are implicitly initialized to 0
at <i>compile time</i>.
