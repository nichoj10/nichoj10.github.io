Today I got an e-mail asking about a previous article on [creating
threads on Linux using raw system calls][raw] (specifically x86-64).
The questioner was looking to use threads in a program without any
libc dependency. However, he was concerned about checking for mmap(2)
errors when allocating the thread's stack. The [mmap(2) man
page][mmap] says it returns -1 (a.k.a. `MAP_FAILED`) on error and sets
errno. But how do you check errno without libc?

As a reminder here's what the (unoptimized) assembly looks like.

~~~nasm
stack_create:
    mov rdi, 0
    mov rsi, STACK_SIZE
    mov rdx, PROT_WRITE | PROT_READ
    mov r10, MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_GROWSDOWN
    mov rax, SYS_mmap
    syscall
    ret
~~~

As usual, the system call return value is in `rax`, which becomes the
return value for `stack_create()`. Again, its C prototype would look
like this:

~~~c
void *stack_create(void);
~~~

If you were to, say, intentionally botch the arguments to force an
error, you might notice that the system call isn't returning -1, but
other negative values. What gives?

The trick is that **errno is a C concept**. That's why it's documented
as [errno(3)][errno] â€” the 3 means it belongs to C. Just think about
how messy this thing is: it's a thread-local value living in the
application's address space. The kernel rightfully has nothing to do
with it. Instead, the mmap(2) wrapper in libc assigns errno (if
needed) after the system call returns. This is how [*all* system calls
through libc work][intro], even with the [syscall(2)
wrapper][syscall].

So how does the kernel report the error? It's an old-fashioned return
value. If you have any doubts, take it straight from the horse's
mouth: [mm/mmap.c:do_mmap()][mm]. Here's a sample of return
statements.

~~~c
if (!len)
        return -EINVAL;

/* Careful about overflows.. */
len = PAGE_ALIGN(len);
if (!len)
        return -ENOMEM;

/* offset overflow? */
if ((pgoff + (len >> PAGE_SHIFT)) < pgoff)
        return -EOVERFLOW;

/* Too many mappings? */
if (mm->map_count > sysctl_max_map_count)
        return -ENOMEM;
~~~

It's returning the negated error number. Simple enough.

If you think about it a moment, you might notice a complication: This
is a form of in-band signaling. On success, mmap(2) returns a memory
address. All those negative error numbers are potentially addresses
that a caller might want to map. How can we tell the difference?

1) None of the possible error numbers align on a page boundary, so
   they're not actually valid return values. NULL *does* lie on a page
   boundary, which is one reason why it's not used as an error return
   value for mmap(2). The other is that you might actually want to map
   NULL, for better [or worse][null].

2) Those low negative values lie in a region of virtual memory
   reserved exclusively for the kernel (sometimes called "[low
   memory][lowmem]"). On x86-64, any address with the most significant
   bit set (i.e. the sign bit of a signed integer) is one of these
   addresses. Processes aren't allowed to map these addresses, and so
   mmap(2) will never return such a value on success.

So what's a clean, safe way to go about checking for error values?
It's a lot easier to read [musl][musl] than glibc, so let's take a
peek at how musl does it in its own mmap: [src/mman/mmap.c][muslmm].

~~~c
if (off & OFF_MASK) {
    errno = EINVAL;
    return MAP_FAILED;
}
if (len >= PTRDIFF_MAX) {
    errno = ENOMEM;
    return MAP_FAILED;
}
if (flags & MAP_FIXED) {
    __vm_wait();
}
return (void *)syscall(SYS_mmap, start, len, prot, flags, fd, off);
~~~

Hmm, it looks like its returning the result directly. What happened
to setting errno? Well, syscall() is actually a macro that runs the
result through \_\_syscall\_ret().

~~~c
#define syscall(...) __syscall_ret(__syscall(__VA_ARGS__))
~~~

Looking a little deeper: [src/internal/syscall_ret.c][ret].

~~~c
long __syscall_ret(unsigned long r)
{
    if (r > -4096UL) {
        errno = -r;
        return -1;
    }
    return r;
}
~~~

Bingo. As documented, if the value falls within that "high" (unsigned)
range of negative values for *any* system call, it's an error number.

Getting back to the original question, we could employ this same check
in the assembly code. However, since this is a anonymous memory map
with a kernel-selected address, **there's only one possible error:
ENOMEM** (12). This error happens if the maximum number of memory maps
has been reached, or if there's no contiguous region available for the
4MB stack. The check will only need to test the result against -12.
