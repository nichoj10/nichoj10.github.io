<p>
The 3n + 1 conjecture, also known as
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz
conjecture</a>, is based around this recursive function,
</p>
<p class="center">
  <img src="/img/misc/collatz.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
The conjecture is this,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which
    positive integer is chosen initially.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The way I am defining this may not be entirely accurate, as I took a
shortcut to make it a bit simpler. I am not a mathematician (IANAM) â€”
but sometimes I pretend to be one. For a really solid definition,
click through to the Wikipedia article in the link above.
</p>
<p>
A sample run, starting at 7, would look like this: <code>7, 22, 11,
34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</code>. The sequence
starting at 7 contains 17 numbers. So 7 has a <i>cycle-length</i> of
17. Currently, there is no known positive integer that does not
eventually lead to 1. If the conjecture is true, then none exists to
be found.
</p>
<p>
I first found out about the problem when I saw it
on <a href="http://icpcres.ecs.baylor.edu/onlinejudge/">UVa Online
Judge</a>. UVa Online Judge is a system that has a couple thousand
programming problems to do. Users can submit solution programs written
in C, C++, Java, or Pascal. For normal submissions, the fastest
program wins.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the way UVa Online Judge runs this problem is by providing the
solution program pairs of integers on <code>stdin</code> as text. The
integers define an inclusive range of integers over which the program
must return the length of the longest Collatz cycle-length for all the
integers inside that range. They don't tell you which ranges they are
checking, except that all integers will be less than 1,000,000 and the
sequences will never overflow a 32-bit integer (allowing shortcuts to
be made to increase performance).
</p>
<p>
The simple approach would be defining a function that returns the
cycle length (<a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> programming
language),
</p>
<pre>
function collatz_len (n)
   local c = 1

   while n > 1 do
      c = c + 1
      if math.mod(n, 2) == 0 then
         n = n / 2
      else
         n = 3 * n + 1
      end
   end

   return c
end
</pre>
<p>
Then we have a function check over a range (assuming n &lt;= m here),
</p>
<pre>
function check_range (n, m)
   local largest = 0

   for i = n, m do
      local len = collatz_len (i)

      if len > largest then
         largest = len
      end

   end

   return largest
end
</pre>
<p>
And top it off with the i/o. (I am just learning Lua, so I hope I did
this part properly!)
</p>
<pre>
while not io.stdin.eof do
   n, m = io.stdin:read("*number", "*number")

   -- check for eof
   if n == nil or m == nil then
      break
   end

   print (n .. " " .. m .. " " .. check_range(n, m))
end
</pre>
<p>
Notice anything extremely inefficient? We are doing the same work over
and over again! Take, for example, this range: 7, 22. When we start
with 7, we get the sequence shown above: <code>7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52,
26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</code>. Eight of these numbers
are part of the range that we are looking at. When we get up to 22, we
are going to walk down the same range again, less the 7. To make
things more efficient, we apply
some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">
dynamic programming</a> and store previous calculated cycle-lengths in
an array. Once we get to a value we already calculated, we just look
it up.
</p>
<p>
I used dynamic programming in my submission, which I wrote up in
C. You can grab my
source <a href="/download/collatz/collatz.c">
here</a>. It fills in a large array (1000000 entries) as values are
found, so no cycle-length is calculated twice. When I submitted this
program, it ranked 60 out of about 300,000 entries. There are probably
a number of tweaks that can increase performance, such as increasing
the size of the array, but I didn't care much about inching closer to
the top. I would bet that the very top entries did some
trial-and-error and determined what ranges are tested, using the
results to seed their program accordingly. You could take my code and
submit it yourself, but that wouldn't be very honest, would it?
</p>
<p>
So why am I going through all of this describing such a simple
problem? Well, it is because of this neat feature of Lua that applies
well to this problem. Lua is kind of like Lisp. In Lisp, everything is
a list ("list processing" --> Lis<i>p</i>). In Lua, (almost)
everything is an associative array (Maybe they should have called it
Assp? Or Hashp?  I am kidding.) An object is a hash with fields
containing function references. There is even
some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar"> syntactic
sugar</a> to help this along.
</p>
<p>
The cool thing is that we can create a hash with default entries that
reference a function that calculates the Collatz cycle-length of its
key. Once the cycle-length is calculated, the function reference is
replaced with the value, so the function is never called again from
that point. The function only actually determines the next integer,
then references the hash to get the cycle-length of that next integer.
</p>
<p>
Now this hash looks like it is infinitely large. This is really a form
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation"> lazy
evaluation</a>: no values are calculated until they are needed (this
is one of my favorite things about <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">
Haskell</a>). We don't need to explicitly ask for it to be calculated,
either. We just go along looking up values in the array as if they
were always there. Here is how you do it,
</p>
<pre>
collatz_len = { 1 }

setmetatable (collatz_len, {
   __index = function (name, n)
      if (math.mod (n, 2) == 0) then
         name[n] = name[n/2] + 1;
      else
         name[n] = name[3 * n + 1] + 1;
      end
         return name[n]
   end
})
</pre>
<p>
So we replace the <code>collatz_len</code> function with this array
(and replace the call to an array reference) and we have applied
dynamic programming to our old program. If I run the two programs with
this sample input,
</p>
<pre>
10 1000
1000 3000
300 500
</pre>
<p>
and look at average running times, the dynamic programming version
runs 87% faster than the original.
</p>
<p>
One problem with this, though, is the use of recursion. In Lua, it is
really easy to hit recursion limits. For example, accessing element
10000 will cause the program to crash. This will probably get fixed
someday, or in some implementation of Lua.
</p>
<p>
I thought there might be a way to do this in Perl, by changing the
default hash value from <code>undef</code> to something else, but I
was mildly disappointed to find out that this is not true.
