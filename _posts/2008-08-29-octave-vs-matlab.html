At work they recently moved me to a new project. It is a Matlab-based
data analysis thing. I haven't really touched Matlab in over a year
(the last time I used Matlab at work), and, instead, use GNU Octave at
home when the language is appropriate. I got so used to Octave that I
found a pretty critical feature missing from Matlab's implementation:
treat an expression as if it were of the type of its output.
</p>
<p>
Let's say we want to index into the result of a function. Take, for
example, the magic square function, <code>magic()</code>. This spits
out a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square">magic square</a>
of the given size. In Octave we can generate a 4x4 magic square and
chop out the middle 2x2 portion in one line.
</p>
<pre>
octave> magic(4)(2:3,2:3)
ans =

   11   10
    7    6
</pre>
<p>
Or more possibly clearly,
</p>
<pre>
octave> [magic(4)](2:3,2:3)
ans =

   11   10
    7    6
</pre>
<p>
Try this in Matlab and you will get a big, fat error. You have to
assign the magic square to a temporary variable to do the same
thing. I kept trying to do this sort of thing in Matlab and was
thinking to myself, "I <i>know</i> I can do this somehow!". Nope, I
was just used to having Octave.
</p>
<p>
Where this really shows is when you want to reshape a matrix into a
nice, simple vector. If you have a matrix <code>M</code> and want to
count the number of NaN's it has, you can't just apply
the <code>sum()</code> function over <code>isnan()</code> because it
only does sums of columns. You can get around this with a special
index, <code>(:)</code>.
</p>
<p>
So, to sum all elements in <code>M</code> directly,
</p>
<pre>
octave> sum(M(:))
</pre>
<p>
In Octave, to count NaN's with <code>isnan()</code>,
</p>
<pre>
octave> sum(isnan(M)(:))
</pre>
<p>
Again, Matlab won't let you index the result of <code>isnan()</code>
directly. Stupid. I guess the Matlab way to do this is to
apply <code>sum()</code> twice.
</p>
<p> Every language I can think of handles this properly. C, C++, Perl,
Ruby, etc. It is strange that Matlab itself doesn't have it. Score one
more for Octave.
