<p>
A feature unique to some Lisps is the ability to compile functions
individually at any time. This could be to a bytecode or native code,
depending on the dialect and implementation. In a Lisp implementations
where compilation matters (such as <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">
CLISP</a>), there are typically two forms in which code can be
evaluated: a slower, unoptimized uncompiled form and a fast, efficient
compiled form. The uncompiled form would have some sort of advantage,
even if it's merely not having to spend time on compilation.
</p>
<p>
In Emacs Lisp, the uncompiled form of a function is just a lambda
s-expression. The only thing that gives it a name is the symbol it's
stored in. The compiled form is a (special) vector, with the actual
byte codes stored in a string as the second element. Constants, the
docstring, and other things are stored in this function vector as
well. The Elisp function to compile functions
is <code>byte-compile</code>. It can be given a lambda function or a
symbol. In the case of a symbol, the compiled function is installed
over top of the s-expression form.
</p>
<pre>
(byte-compile (lambda (x) (* 2 x)))
  <i>=&gt; #[(x) "^H\301_\207" [x 2] 2]</i>
</pre>
<p>
The compiler will not only convert the function to bytecode and expand
macros, but also perform optimizations such as removing dead code,
evaluating safe constant forms, and inline functions. This provides a
nice performance boost (testing using my <a href="/blog/2009/05/28/">
measure-time macro</a>),
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun fib (n)
  "Fibonacci sequence."
  (if (<= n 2) 1
    (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
{% endhighlight %}
<pre>
(measure-time
 (fib 30))
  <i>=&gt; 1.0508708953857422</i>

(byte-compile 'fib)

(measure-time
 (fib 30))
  <i>=&gt; 0.4302399158477783</i>
</pre>
<p>
Most of the installed functions in a typical Emacs instance are
already compiled, since they are loaded already compiled. But a number
of them <i>aren't</i> compiled. So, I thought, why not spend a few
seconds to do this?
</p>
<p>
In Common Lisp, there is a predicate for testing whether a function
has been compiled or not: <code>compiled-function-p</code>. For
whatever reason, there is no equivalent predefined in Elisp, so I
wrote one,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun byte-compiled-p (func)
  "Return t if function is byte compiled."
  (cond
   ((symbolp   func) (byte-compiled-p (symbol-function func)))
   ((functionp func) (not (sequencep func)))
   (t nil)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
My idea was to iterate over every interned symbol and, if the function
slot contains an uncompiled function, using the test above, I would
call <code>byte-compile</code> on it. Well, it turns out
that <code>byte-compile</code> is very flexible and will ignore
symbols with no function and symbols with already compiled functions.
</p>
<p>
So next, how do we iterate over every interned symbol? There is
a <code>mapatoms</code> function for this. Provide it a function and
it calls it on every interned symbol. Well, that's simple and
anticlimactic.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(mapatoms 'byte-compile)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
That's it! It will take only a few seconds and spew a lot of
warnings. I haven't found a way to disable those warnings, so this
isn't something you'd want to have run automatically, unless you like
having an extra window thrown in your face. I've only discovered this
recently, so I'm not sure what sort of bad things this may do to your
Emacs session. Not every function was written with compilation in
mind. There are interactions with macros to consider.
</p>
<p>
I doubt there will be a noticeable performance difference. Like I said
before, most everything is already compiled, and those are the
functions that get used the most. There's just something nice about
knowing all your functions are compiled and optimized.
