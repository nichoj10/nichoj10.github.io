<p>
As part of my quest of developing solid knowledge of <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> lisp, I have
implemented a pseudo-HTTP/1.0 web server within Emacs. Behold,
</p>
<pre>
git clone <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-http-server">git://github.com/skeeto/emacs-http-server.git</a>
</pre>
<p>
To all other non-emacsen text editors, can your text editor do that?!
Ha! Even though elisp is a slow, closure-less, dynamically scoped,
ugly cousin of more popular lisps, it's still a lot of fun to write.
</p>
<p>
To fire it up, load it into Emacs and run the extended command
(<code>M-x</code>) <code>httpd-start</code>. By default it will serve
files from "<code>~/public_html</code>". To change this, change the
variable <code>httpd-root</code> to the desired web root. You can stop
the server with <code>httpd-stop</code>.
</p>
<p>
It's about 200 lines of code and can serve static websites made of
small, static files. I say small files because it serves files from
buffers, meaning it has to read the entire file in first.
</p>
<p>
For a simple, text editor based server it can hold up to a pretty
decent load. At one point I hit it with 8 <code>wget</code> instances all making
rapid recursive downloads and my manual navigation wasn't slowed down
noticeably. Despite running in the slow elisp interpreter, I think it
can have much better performance by caching commonly served files in
buffers.
</p>
<p>
It <i>should</i> run, unmodified, anywhere a modern Emacs can run, so
I expect that it's already very portable. I can imagine it being
useful in a situation where someone needs to temporarily host some
files but there isn't a web server on the machine. Just grab this
script and throw it at Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Well, it only does IPv4 right now, though I expect IPv6 only requires
changing one number (namely, 4 to 6). I don't have any IPv6 systems to
test it on.
</p>
<p>
When writing it I also had security in mind so, as far as I know, it
should be safe to use. It cleans up the <code>GET</code> from the
client so that no files underneath the serving root can be accessed.
</p>
<p>
The server log is lisp itself. Here is an example log starting the
server, serving one request, and halting,
</p>
<pre>
'(log
  (start "Wed May 13 23:33:34 2009")
  (connection
   (date "Wed May 13 23:36:25 2009")
   (address "192.168.0.3")
   (get "/0001.html")
   (req
    ("Referer" "http://192.168.0.2:8080/")
    ("Connection" "keep-alive")
    ("Keep-Alive" "300")
    ("Accept-Charset" "ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7")
    ("Accept-Encoding" "gzip,deflate")
    ("Accept-Language" "en-us,en;q=0.5")
    ("Accept" "image/png,image/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.5")
    ("User-Agent" "Mozilla/5.0 [...] Iceweasel/3.0.9 (Debian-3.0.9-1)")
    ("Host" "192.168.0.2:8080")
    ("GET" "/0001.html" "HTTP/1.1"))
   (path "~/public_html/0001.html")
   (status 200))
  (stop "Wed May 13 23:38:17 2009"))
</pre>
<p>
The log is alists of alists, making a hierarchical tree structure that
can be explored with some simple lisp functions. Normally this sort of
thing is done with XML, but lisp already has its own structured
format: lists!
</p>
<p>
When <code>GET</code> is a directory, it looks for
"<code>index.html</code>" and serves that if it exists. More indexes
can be added to the variable <code>httpd-indexes</code>. This can
actually be done in a special "<code>.htaccess.el</code>" file.
</p>
<p>
If a "<code>.htaccess.el</code>" exists in the directory from which a
file is being served, Emacs will first load/execute it. You see, it's
just a lisp program. If you wanted to add a new index file name, the
hypertext access file could contain this,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(add-to-list 'httpd-indexes "0001.html")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
It's a bit like a <code>.emacs</code> file.
</p>
<p>
But I think one of the coolest things about having a lisp-based server
is that the server can be modified in place without disrupting or
restarting it. In my Emacs web server, the only change that requires a
restart is changing the server port. In fact, I wrote most of it while
the server was running and tested my changes from a browser right as I
made them â€” all on the same instance of the server.
</p>
<p>
If you want to look into the AI side of this, the server could modify
its own code in response to its use.
</p>
<p>
I also had the idea of creating dynamic websites with elisp, in the
same way PHP or Perl does. If a <code>.el</code> file (or
<code>.elc</code>) is accessed, the server would pass the
<code>GET</code>/<code>POST</code> arguments as an alist to a function
in the elisp file. The server would also provide some nifty HTML
generation macros. A dynamic script might look like this,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun script (get)
  (html
   (head
    (title "My Script"))
   (body
    (h1 "Your Query")
    (p (concat "Your query was "
               (html-sanitize (cdr (assoc "q" get)) "."))))))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
However, this is not (yet?) implemented. Just an idea.
</p>
<p>
I will continue to work on it, though I don't expect to add much more
to it. I will mostly improve the code and documentation.
</p>
