<!-- 4 February 2010 -->
<p>
I've been chugging away on Wisp, <a href="/blog/2010/01/24/">announced
in my last post</a>, every day since I started it a few weeks ago, and
it's becoming a pretty solid system. There's now an exception system,
reference counting for dealing with garbage, and a reentrant
parser. It's no replacement for any other lisps, but I've found it to
be very fun to work on.
</p>
<pre>
git clone <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/wisp">git://github.com/skeeto/wisp.git</a>
</pre>
<p>
I wanted to show off some of the new features of Wisp, and since I was
inspired by <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/fulldisclojure"> Full
Disclojure</a>, since it's so damn slick, I decided to make some
screencasts of Wisp in action. All of the screencast software for
GNU/Linux is pretty poor, but after a few hours of head-banging I
managed to hobble something together for you. Enjoy!

  <video src="/vid/wisp/wisp-memoize.ogv" controls>
    Since your browser doesn't seem to support the video tag, here's a
    link to the video: <a href="/vid/wisp/wisp-memoize.ogv">
    wisp-memoize.ogv</a>.
  </video>
</p>
<p>
That video demonstrated the memoization function. It can be pulled in
from the <code>memoize</code> library. You give it a symbol, which
should have a function definition stored in it, and it will installed a
wrapper around it. In the video I used the Fibonacci function from
the <code>examples</code> library.
</p>
<pre>
(require 'examples)
(fib 30) ; Slooooow ...
(memoize 'fib)
(fib 100) ; Fast!
</pre>

  <video src="/vid/wisp/wisp-detach.ogv" controls>
    Since your browser doesn't seem to support the video tag, here's a
    link to the video: <a href="/vid/wisp/wisp-detach.ogv">
    wisp-detach.ogv</a>.
  </video>
</p>
<p>
This demonstrated the "detachment" feature of Wisp, which is similar
to "futures" in Clojure. It forks off a new process, which executes
the given function. The <code>send</code> function can be used in the
detached process to send any lisp objects back to the parents, which
can receive them with the <code>receive</code>
function. The <code>send</code> function can be called any number of
times to continually send data back. The <code>receive</code> function
will block if there is no lisp object to receive yet.
</p>
<pre>
(require 'examples)
(setq d (detach (lambda () (send (fib)))))
(receive d) ; Gets value from child process
</pre>

  <video src="/vid/wisp/wisp-point-free.ogv" controls>
    Since your browser doesn't seem to support the video tag, here's a
    link to the video: <a href="/vid/wisp/wisp-point-free.ogv">
    wisp-point-free.ogv</a>.
  </video>
</p>
<p>
This video shows off the point-free functions that have been defined:
function composition and partial application (I accidentally say
"partial evaluation" in the video). These are actually just simple
macros that any lisp could do.
