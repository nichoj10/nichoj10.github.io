<h1 style="text-align: center;">Browser URL Mangling Test</h1>
<p>
This is a simple test to see if your browser is automatically mangling
your URLs. The following links will either take you to the correctly
specified page ("Good!") or another incorrect URL it fabricated
("Bad!"). There are no links here to the "bad" page, so if you are
taken there your browser did something wrong.
</p>
<p>
Note, the manual and automatic tests maye give different results if
the browser mangles <code>http-equiv="refresh"</code> URLs differently
than normal links (the case with Opera).

<h2>Manual Test</h2>
<h3>Test 1</h3>
<p>
<a href="pre\index.html">Test Link</a>
</p>
<p>
If you got the "bad" page, your browser is silently modifying the URL
to accommodate the arbitrary limitations of Windows. Specifically,
it's incorrectly changing backslashes (\) to slashes (/).
</p>
<h3>Test 2</h3>
<p>
<a href="pre%5Cindex.html">Test Link</a>
</p>
<p>
This link <i>must</i> take you to the right page, otherwise your
browser is completely broken. If you went to the wrong page here then
it is impossible to point your browser to the right page. I am not
aware of any browsers that fail this test.
